    ,
      [SCENE.--A room furnished comfortably and
      tastefully, but not extravagantly. At the back, a door to the right leads
      to the entrance-hall, another to the left leads to Helmer's study. Between
      the doors stands a piano. In the middle of the left-hand wall is a door,
      and beyond it a window. Near the window are a round table, arm-chairs and
      a small sofa. In the right-hand wall, at the farther end, another door;
      and on the same side, nearer the footlights, a stove, two easy chairs and
      a rocking-chair; between the stove and the door, a small table. Engravings
      on the walls; a cabinet with china and other small objects; a small
      book-case with well-bound books. The floors are carpeted, and a fire burns
      in the stove.

      It is winter. A bell rings in the hall;
      shortly afterwards the door is heard to open. Enter NORA, humming a tune
      and in high spirits. She is in outdoor dress and carries a number of
      parcels; these she lays on the table to the right. She leaves the outer
      door open after her, and through it is seen a PORTER who is carrying a
      Christmas Tree and a basket, which he gives to the MAID who has opened the

      Nora. Hide the Christmas Tree carefully,
      Helen. Be sure the children do not see it until this evening, when it is
      dressed. [To the PORTER, taking out her
      purse.] How much?
    ,Nora,[To the PORTER, taking out her
      purse.],
      Porter. Sixpence.
    ,Porter,
      Nora. There is a shilling. No, keep the
      change. [The PORTER thanks her, and goes
      out. NORA shuts the door. She is laughing to herself, as she takes off her
      hat and coat. She takes a packet of macaroons from her pocket and eats one
      or two; then goes cautiously to her husband's door and listens.]
      Yes, he is in. [Still humming, she goes to
      the table on the right.]

      Helmer [calls
      out from his room]. Is that my little lark twittering out there?
    ,Helmer ,[calls
      out from his room],
      Nora [busy
      opening some of the parcels]. Yes, it is!
    ,Nora ,[busy
      opening some of the parcels],
      Helmer. Is it my little squirrel bustling
      about?
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. Yes!
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. When did my squirrel come home?
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. Just now. [Puts the bag of macaroons into her pocket and
      wipes her mouth.] Come in here, Torvald, and see what I have
      bought.
    ,Nora,[Puts the bag of macaroons into her pocket and
      wipes her mouth.],
      Helmer. Don't disturb me. [A little later, he opens the door and looks into
      the room, pen in hand.] Bought, did you say? All these things? Has
      my little spendthrift been wasting money again?
    ,Helmer,[A little later, he opens the door and looks into
      the room, pen in hand.],
      Nora. Yes but, Torvald, this year we really
      can let ourselves go a little. This is the first Christmas that we have
      not needed to economise.
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. Still, you know, we can't spend
      money recklessly.
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. Yes, Torvald, we may be a wee bit
      more reckless now, mayn't we? Just a tiny wee bit! You are going to have a
      big salary and earn lots and lots of money.
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. Yes, after the New Year; but then
      it will be a whole quarter before the salary is due.
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. Pooh! we can borrow until then.
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. Nora! [Goes
      up to her and takes her playfully by the ear.] The same little
      featherhead! Suppose, now, that I borrowed fifty pounds today, and you
      spent it all in the Christmas week, and then on New Year's Eve a slate
      fell on my head and killed me, and--
    ,Helmer,[Goes
      up to her and takes her playfully by the ear.],
      Nora [putting
      her hands over his mouth]. Oh! don't say such horrid things.
    ,Nora,[putting
      her hands over his mouth],
      Helmer. Still, suppose that happened,--what
      then?
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. If that were to happen, I don't
      suppose I should care whether I owed money or not.
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. Yes, but what about the people who
      had lent it?
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. They? Who would bother about them? I
      should not know who they were.
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. That is like a woman! But
      seriously, Nora, you know what I think about that. No debt, no borrowing.
      There can be no freedom or beauty about a home life that depends on
      borrowing and debt. We two have kept bravely on the straight road so far,
      and we will go on the same way for the short time longer that there need
      be any struggle.
    ,Helmer,
      Nora [moving
      towards the stove]. As you please, Torvald.
    ,Nora ,[moving
      towards the stove],
      Helmer [following
      her]. Come, come, my little skylark must not droop her wings. What
      is this! Is my little squirrel out of temper? [Taking
      out his purse.] Nora, what do you think I have got here?
    ,Helmer ,[following
      her],[Taking
      out his purse.],
      Nora [turning
      round quickly]. Money!
    ,Nora ,[turning
      round quickly],
      Helmer. There you are. [Gives her some money.] Do you think I
      don't know what a lot is wanted for housekeeping at Christmas-time?
    ,Helmer,[Gives her some money.],
      Nora [counting].
      Ten shillings--a pound--two pounds! Thank you, thank you, Torvald; that
      will keep me going for a long time.
    ,Nora ,[counting],
      Helmer. Indeed it must.
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. Yes, yes, it will. But come here and
      let me show you what I have bought. And all so cheap! Look, here is a new
      suit for Ivar, and a sword; and a horse and a trumpet for Bob; and a doll
      and dolly's bedstead for Emmy,--they are very plain, but anyway she will
      soon break them in pieces. And here are dress-lengths and handkerchiefs
      for the maids; old Anne ought really to have something better.
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. And what is in this parcel?
    ,Helmer,
      Nora [crying
      out]. No, no! you mustn't see that until this evening.
    ,Nora ,[crying
      out],
      Helmer. Very well. But now tell me, you
      extravagant little person, what would you like for yourself?
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. For myself? Oh, I am sure I don't
      want anything.
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. Yes, but you must. Tell me
      something reasonable that you would particularly like to have.
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. No, I really can't think of
      anything--unless, Torvald--
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. Well?
    ,Helmer,
      Nora [playing
      with his coat buttons, and without raising her eyes to his]. If you
      really want to give me something, you might--you might--
    ,Nora ,[playing
      with his coat buttons, and without raising her eyes to his],
      Helmer. Well, out with it!
    ,Helmer,
      Nora [speaking
      quickly]. You might give me money, Torvald. Only just as much as
      you can afford; and then one of these days I will buy something with it.
    ,Nora ,[speaking
      quickly],
      Helmer. But, Nora--
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. Oh, do! dear Torvald; please, please
      do! Then I will wrap it up in beautiful gilt paper and hang it on the
      Christmas Tree. Wouldn't that be fun?
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. What are little people called that
      are always wasting money?
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. Spendthrifts--I know. Let us do as
      you suggest, Torvald, and then I shall have time to think what I am most
      in want of. That is a very sensible plan, isn't it?
    ,Nora,
      Helmer [smiling].
      Indeed it is--that is to say, if you were really to save out of the money
      I give you, and then really buy something for yourself. But if you spend
      it all on the housekeeping and any number of unnecessary things, then I
      merely have to pay up again.
    ,Helmer ,[smiling],
      Nora. Oh but, Torvald--
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. You can't deny it, my dear little
      Nora. [Puts his arm round her waist.]
      It's a sweet little spendthrift, but she uses up a deal of money. One
      would hardly believe how expensive such little persons are!
    ,Helmer,[Puts his arm round her waist.],
      Nora. It's a shame to say that. I do really
      save all I can.
    ,Nora,
      Helmer [laughing].
      That's very true,--all you can. But you can't save anything!
    ,Helmer ,[laughing],
      Nora [smiling
      quietly and happily]. You haven't any idea how many expenses we
      skylarks and squirrels have, Torvald.
    ,Nora ,[smiling
      quietly and happily],
      Helmer. You are an odd little soul. Very
      like your father. You always find some new way of wheedling money out of
      me, and, as soon as you have got it, it seems to melt in your hands. You
      never know where it has gone. Still, one must take you as you are. It is
      in the blood; for indeed it is true that you can inherit these things,
      Nora.
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. Ah, I wish I had inherited many of
      papa's qualities.
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. And I would not wish you to be
      anything but just what you are, my sweet little skylark. But, do you know,
      it strikes me that you are looking rather--what shall I say--rather uneasy
      today?
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. Do I?
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. You do, really. Look straight at
      me.
    ,Helmer,
      Nora [looks
      at him]. Well?
    ,Nora ,[looks
      at him],
      Helmer [wagging
      his finger at her]. Hasn't Miss Sweet Tooth been breaking rules in
      town today?
    ,Helmer ,[wagging
      his finger at her],
      Nora. No; what makes you think that?
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. Hasn't she paid a visit to the
      confectioner's?
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. No, I assure you, Torvald--
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. Not been nibbling sweets?
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. No, certainly not.
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. Not even taken a bite at a macaroon
      or two?
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. No, Torvald, I assure you really--
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. There, there, of course I was only
      joking.
    ,Helmer,
      Nora [going
      to the table on the right]. I should not think of going against
      your wishes.
    ,Nora ,[going
      to the table on the right],
      Helmer. No, I am sure of that; besides, you
      gave me your word-- [Going up to her.]
      Keep your little Christmas secrets to yourself, my darling. They will all
      be revealed tonight when the Christmas Tree is lit, no doubt.
    ,Helmer,[Going up to her.],
      Nora. Did you remember to invite Doctor
      Rank?
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. No. But there is no need; as a
      matter of course he will come to dinner with us. However, I will ask him
      when he comes in this morning. I have ordered some good wine. Nora, you
      can't think how I am looking forward to this evening.
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. So am I! And how the children will
      enjoy themselves, Torvald!
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. It is splendid to feel that one has
      a perfectly safe appointment, and a big enough income. It's delightful to
      think of, isn't it?
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. It's wonderful!
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. Do you remember last Christmas? For
      a full three weeks beforehand you shut yourself up every evening until
      long after midnight, making ornaments for the Christmas Tree, and all the
      other fine things that were to be a surprise to us. It was the dullest
      three weeks I ever spent!
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. I didn't find it dull.
    ,Nora,
      Helmer [smiling].
      But there was precious little result, Nora.
    ,Helmer ,[smiling],
      Nora. Oh, you shouldn't tease me about that
      again. How could I help the cat's going in and tearing everything to
      pieces?
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. Of course you couldn't, poor little
      girl. You had the best of intentions to please us all, and that's the main
      thing. But it is a good thing that our hard times are over.
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. Yes, it is really wonderful.
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. This time I needn't sit here and be
      dull all alone, and you needn't ruin your dear eyes and your pretty little
      hands--
    ,Helmer,
      Nora [clapping
      her hands]. No, Torvald, I needn't any longer, need I! It's
      wonderfully lovely to hear you say so! [Taking
      his arm.] Now I will tell you how I have been thinking we ought to
      arrange things, Torvald. As soon as Christmas is over--[A bell rings in the hall.] There's the
      bell. [She tidies the room a little.]
      There's some one at the door. What a nuisance!
    ,Nora ,[clapping
      her hands],[Taking
      his arm.],[A bell rings in the hall.],[She tidies the room a little.],
      Helmer. If it is a caller, remember I am
      not at home.
    ,Helmer,
      Maid [in the
      doorway]. A lady to see you, ma'am,--a stranger.
    ,Maid ,[in the
      doorway],
      Nora. Ask her to come in.
    ,Nora,
      Maid [to
      HELMER]. The doctor came at the same time, sir.
    ,Maid ,[to
      HELMER],
      Helmer. Did he go straight into my room?
    ,Helmer,
      Maid. Yes, sir.
    ,Maid,
      [HELMER goes into his room. The MAID ushers
      in Mrs Linde, who is in travelling dress, and shuts the door.]
    ,[HELMER goes into his room. The MAID ushers
      in Mrs Linde, who is in travelling dress, and shuts the door.],
      Mrs Linde [in
      a dejected and timid voice]. How do you do, Nora?
    ,Mrs Linde,[in
      a dejected and timid voice],
      Nora [doubtfully].
      How do you do--
    ,Nora ,[doubtfully],
      Mrs Linde. You don't recognise me, I
      suppose.
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Nora. No, I don't know--yes, to be sure, I
      seem to--[Suddenly.] Yes! Christine!
      Is it really you?
    ,Nora,[Suddenly.],
      Mrs Linde. Yes, it is I.
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Nora. Christine! To think of my not
      recognising you! And yet how could I--[In a
      gentle voice.] How you have altered, Christine!
    ,Nora,[In a
      gentle voice.],
      Mrs Linde. Yes, I have indeed. In nine, ten
      long years--
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Nora. Is it so long since we met? I suppose
      it is. The last eight years have been a happy time for me, I can tell you.
      And so now you have come into the town, and have taken this long journey
      in winter--that was plucky of you.
    ,Nora,
      Mrs Linde. I arrived by steamer this
      morning.
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Nora. To have some fun at Christmas-time,
      of course. How delightful! We will have such fun together! But take off
      your things. You are not cold, I hope. [Helps
      her.] Now we will sit down by the stove, and be cosy. No, take this
      armchair; I will sit here in the rocking-chair. [Takes her hands.] Now you look like your
      old self again; it was only the first moment--You are a little paler,
      Christine, and perhaps a little thinner.
    ,Nora,[Helps
      her.],[Takes her hands.],
      Mrs Linde. And much, much older, Nora.
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Nora. Perhaps a little older; very, very
      little; certainly not much. [Stops suddenly
      and speaks seriously.] What a thoughtless creature I am, chattering
      away like this. My poor, dear Christine, do forgive me.
    ,Nora,[Stops suddenly
      and speaks seriously.],
      Mrs Linde. What do you mean, Nora?
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Nora [gently].
      Poor Christine, you are a widow.
    ,Nora ,[gently],
      Mrs Linde. Yes; it is three years ago now.
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Nora. Yes, I knew; I saw it in the papers.
      I assure you, Christine, I meant ever so often to write to you at the
      time, but I always put it off and something always prevented me.
    ,Nora,
      Mrs Linde. I quite understand, dear.
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Nora. It was very bad of me, Christine.
      Poor thing, how you must have suffered. And he left you nothing?
    ,Nora,
      Mrs Linde. No.
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Nora. And no children?
    ,Nora,
      Mrs Linde. No.
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Nora. Nothing at all, then.
    ,Nora,
      Mrs Linde. Not even any sorrow or grief to
      live upon.
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Nora [looking
      incredulously at her]. But, Christine, is that possible?
    ,Nora ,[looking
      incredulously at her],
      Mrs Linde [smiles
      sadly and strokes her hair]. It sometimes happens, Nora.
    ,Mrs Linde,[smiles
      sadly and strokes her hair],
      Nora. So you are quite alone. How
      dreadfully sad that must be. I have three lovely children. You can't see
      them just now, for they are out with their nurse. But now you must tell me
      all about it.
    ,Nora,
      Mrs Linde. No, no; I want to hear about
      you.
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Nora. No, you must begin. I mustn't be
      selfish today; today I must only think of your affairs. But there is one
      thing I must tell you. Do you know we have just had a great piece of good
      luck?
    ,Nora,
      Mrs Linde. No, what is it?
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Nora. Just fancy, my husband has been made
      manager of the Bank!
    ,Nora,
      Mrs Linde. Your husband? What good luck!
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Nora. Yes, tremendous! A barrister's
      profession is such an uncertain thing, especially if he won't undertake
      unsavoury cases; and naturally Torvald has never been willing to do that,
      and I quite agree with him. You may imagine how pleased we are! He is to
      take up his work in the Bank at the New Year, and then he will have a big
      salary and lots of commissions. For the future we can live quite
      differently--we can do just as we like. I feel so relieved and so happy,
      Christine! It will be splendid to have heaps of money and not need to have
      any anxiety, won't it?
    ,Nora,
      Mrs Linde. Yes, anyhow I think it would be
      delightful to have what one needs.
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Nora. No, not only what one needs, but
      heaps and heaps of money.
    ,Nora,
      Mrs Linde [smiling].
      Nora, Nora, haven't you learned sense yet? In our schooldays you were a
      great spendthrift.
    ,Mrs Linde,[smiling],
      Nora [laughing].
      Yes, that is what Torvald says now. [Wags
      her finger at her.] But "Nora, Nora" is not so silly as you think.
      We have not been in a position for me to waste money. We have both had to
      work.
    ,Nora ,[laughing],[Wags
      her finger at her.],
      Mrs Linde. You too?
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Nora. Yes; odds and ends, needlework,
      crotchet-work, embroidery, and that kind of thing. [Dropping her voice.] And other things as
      well. You know Torvald left his office when we were married? There was no
      prospect of promotion there, and he had to try and earn more than before.
      But during the first year he over-worked himself dreadfully. You see, he
      had to make money every way he could, and he worked early and late; but he
      couldn't stand it, and fell dreadfully ill, and the doctors said it was
      necessary for him to go south.
    ,Nora,[Dropping her voice.],
      Mrs Linde. You spent a whole year in Italy,
      didn't you?
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Nora. Yes. It was no easy matter to get
      away, I can tell you. It was just after Ivar was born; but naturally we
      had to go. It was a wonderfully beautiful journey, and it saved Torvald's
      life. But it cost a tremendous lot of money, Christine.
    ,Nora,
      Mrs Linde. So I should think.
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Nora. It cost about two hundred and fifty
      pounds. That's a lot, isn't it?
    ,Nora,
      Mrs Linde. Yes, and in emergencies like
      that it is lucky to have the money.
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Nora. I ought to tell you that we had it
      from papa.
    ,Nora,
      Mrs Linde. Oh, I see. It was just about
      that time that he died, wasn't it?
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Nora. Yes; and, just think of it, I
      couldn't go and nurse him. I was expecting little Ivar's birth every day
      and I had my poor sick Torvald to look after. My dear, kind father--I
      never saw him again, Christine. That was the saddest time I have known
      since our marriage.
    ,Nora,
      Mrs Linde. I know how fond you were of him.
      And then you went off to Italy?
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Nora. Yes; you see we had money then, and
      the doctors insisted on our going, so we started a month later.
    ,Nora,
      Mrs Linde. And your husband came back quite
      well?
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Nora. As sound as a bell!
    ,Nora,
      Mrs Linde. But--the doctor?
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Nora. What doctor?
    ,Nora,
      Mrs Linde. I thought your maid said the
      gentleman who arrived here just as I did, was the doctor?
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Nora. Yes, that was Doctor Rank, but he
      doesn't come here professionally. He is our greatest friend, and comes in
      at least once every day. No, Torvald has not had an hour's illness since
      then, and our children are strong and healthy and so am I. [Jumps up and claps her hands.] Christine!
      Christine! it's good to be alive and happy!--But how horrid of me; I am
      talking of nothing but my own affairs. [Sits
      on a stool near her, and rests her arms on her knees.] You mustn't
      be angry with me. Tell me, is it really true that you did not love your
      husband? Why did you marry him?
    ,Nora,[Jumps up and claps her hands.],[Sits
      on a stool near her, and rests her arms on her knees.],
      Mrs Linde. My mother was alive then, and
      was bedridden and helpless, and I had to provide for my two younger
      brothers; so I did not think I was justified in refusing his offer.
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Nora. No, perhaps you were quite right. He
      was rich at that time, then?
    ,Nora,
      Mrs Linde. I believe he was quite well off.
      But his business was a precarious one; and, when he died, it all went to
      pieces and there was nothing left.
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Nora. And then?--
    ,Nora,
      Mrs Linde. Well, I had to turn my hand to
      anything I could find--first a small shop, then a small school, and so on.
      The last three years have seemed like one long working-day, with no rest.
      Now it is at an end, Nora. My poor mother needs me no more, for she is
      gone; and the boys do not need me either; they have got situations and can
      shift for themselves.
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Nora. What a relief you must feel if--
    ,Nora,
      Mrs Linde. No, indeed; I only feel my life
      unspeakably empty. No one to live for anymore. [Gets up restlessly.] That was why I could
      not stand the life in my little backwater any longer. I hope it may be
      easier here to find something which will busy me and occupy my thoughts.
      If only I could have the good luck to get some regular work--office work
      of some kind--
    ,Mrs Linde,[Gets up restlessly.],
      Nora. But, Christine, that is so
      frightfully tiring, and you look tired out now. You had far better go away
      to some watering-place.
    ,Nora,
      Mrs Linde [walking
      to the window]. I have no father to give me money for a journey,
      Nora.
    ,Mrs Linde,[walking
      to the window],
      Nora [rising].
      Oh, don't be angry with me!
    ,Nora ,[rising],
      Mrs Linde [going
      up to her]. It is you that must not be angry with me, dear. The
      worst of a position like mine is that it makes one so bitter. No one to
      work for, and yet obliged to be always on the lookout for chances. One
      must live, and so one becomes selfish. When you told me of the happy turn
      your fortunes have taken--you will hardly believe it--I was delighted not
      so much on your account as on my own.
    ,Mrs Linde,[going
      up to her],
      Nora. How do you mean?--Oh, I understand.
      You mean that perhaps Torvald could get you something to do.
    ,Nora,
      Mrs Linde. Yes, that was what I was
      thinking of.
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Nora. He must, Christine. Just leave it to
      me; I will broach the subject very cleverly--I will think of something
      that will please him very much. It will make me so happy to be of some use
      to you.
    ,Nora,
      Mrs Linde. How kind you are, Nora, to be so
      anxious to help me! It is doubly kind in you, for you know so little of
      the burdens and troubles of life.
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Nora. I--? I know so little of them?
    ,Nora,
      Mrs Linde [smiling].
      My dear! Small household cares and that sort of thing!--You are a child,
      Nora.
    ,Mrs Linde,[smiling],
      Nora [tosses
      her head and crosses the stage]. You ought not to be so superior.
    ,Nora ,[tosses
      her head and crosses the stage],
      Mrs Linde. No?
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Nora. You are just like the others. They
      all think that I am incapable of anything really serious--
    ,Nora,
      Mrs Linde. Come, come--
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Nora.--that I have gone through nothing in
      this world of cares.
    ,Nora,
      Mrs Linde. But, my dear Nora, you have just
      told me all your troubles.
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Nora. Pooh!--those were trifles. [Lowering her voice.] I have not told you
      the important thing.
    ,Nora,[Lowering her voice.],
      Mrs Linde. The important thing? What do you
      mean?
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Nora. You look down upon me altogether,
      Christine--but you ought not to. You are proud, aren't you, of having
      worked so hard and so long for your mother?
    ,Nora,
      Mrs Linde. Indeed, I don't look down on
      anyone. But it is true that I am both proud and glad to think that I was
      privileged to make the end of my mother's life almost free from care.
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Nora. And you are proud to think of what
      you have done for your brothers?
    ,Nora,
      Mrs Linde. I think I have the right to be.
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Nora. I think so, too. But now, listen to
      this; I too have something to be proud and glad of.
    ,Nora,
      Mrs Linde. I have no doubt you have. But
      what do you refer to?
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Nora. Speak low. Suppose Torvald were to
      hear! He mustn't on any account--no one in the world must know, Christine,
      except you.
    ,Nora,
      Mrs Linde. But what is it?
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Nora. Come here. [Pulls her down on the sofa beside her.]
      Now I will show you that I too have something to be proud and glad of. It
      was I who saved Torvald's life.
    ,Nora,[Pulls her down on the sofa beside her.],
      Mrs Linde. "Saved"? How?
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Nora. I told you about our trip to Italy.
      Torvald would never have recovered if he had not gone there--
    ,Nora,
      Mrs Linde. Yes, but your father gave you
      the necessary funds.
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Nora [smiling].
      Yes, that is what Torvald and all the others think, but--
    ,Nora ,[smiling],
      Mrs Linde. But--
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Nora. Papa didn't give us a shilling. It
      was I who procured the money.
    ,Nora,
      Mrs Linde. You? All that large sum?
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Nora. Two hundred and fifty pounds. What do
      you think of that?
    ,Nora,
      Mrs Linde. But, Nora, how could you
      possibly do it? Did you win a prize in the Lottery?
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Nora [contemptuously].
      In the Lottery? There would have been no credit in that.
    ,Nora ,[contemptuously],
      Mrs Linde. But where did you get it from,
      then? Nora [humming and smiling with an air
      of mystery]. Hm, hm! Aha!
    ,Mrs Linde,[humming and smiling with an air
      of mystery],
      Mrs Linde. Because you couldn't have
      borrowed it.
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Nora. Couldn't I? Why not?
    ,Nora,
      Mrs Linde. No, a wife cannot borrow without
      her husband's consent.
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Nora [tossing
      her head]. Oh, if it is a wife who has any head for business--a
      wife who has the wit to be a little bit clever--
    ,Nora ,[tossing
      her head],
      Mrs Linde. I don't understand it at all,
      Nora.
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Nora. There is no need you should. I never
      said I had borrowed the money. I may have got it some other way. [Lies back on the sofa.] Perhaps I got it
      from some other admirer. When anyone is as attractive as I am--
    ,Nora,[Lies back on the sofa.],
      Mrs Linde. You are a mad creature.
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Nora. Now, you know you're full of
      curiosity, Christine.
    ,Nora,
      Mrs Linde. Listen to me, Nora dear. Haven't
      you been a little bit imprudent?
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Nora [sits up
      straight]. Is it imprudent to save your husband's life?
    ,Nora ,[sits up
      straight],
      Mrs Linde. It seems to me imprudent,
      without his knowledge, to--
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Nora. But it was absolutely necessary that
      he should not know! My goodness, can't you understand that? It was
      necessary he should have no idea what a dangerous condition he was in. It
      was to me that the doctors came and said that his life was in danger, and
      that the only thing to save him was to live in the south. Do you suppose I
      didn't try, first of all, to get what I wanted as if it were for myself? I
      told him how much I should love to travel abroad like other young wives; I
      tried tears and entreaties with him; I told him that he ought to remember
      the condition I was in, and that he ought to be kind and indulgent to me;
      I even hinted that he might raise a loan. That nearly made him angry,
      Christine. He said I was thoughtless, and that it was his duty as my
      husband not to indulge me in my whims and caprices--as I believe he called
      them. Very well, I thought, you must be saved--and that was how I came to
      devise a way out of the difficulty--
    ,Nora,
      Mrs Linde. And did your husband never get
      to know from your father that the money had not come from him?
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Nora. No, never. Papa died just at that
      time. I had meant to let him into the secret and beg him never to reveal
      it. But he was so ill then--alas, there never was any need to tell him.
    ,Nora,
      Mrs Linde. And since then have you never
      told your secret to your husband?
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Nora. Good Heavens, no! How could you think
      so? A man who has such strong opinions about these things! And besides,
      how painful and humiliating it would be for Torvald, with his manly
      independence, to know that he owed me anything! It would upset our mutual
      relations altogether; our beautiful happy home would no longer be what it
      is now.
    ,Nora,
      Mrs Linde. Do you mean never to tell him
      about it?
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Nora [meditatively,
      and with a half smile]. Yes--someday, perhaps, after many years,
      when I am no longer as nice-looking as I am now. Don't laugh at me! I
      mean, of course, when Torvald is no longer as devoted to me as he is now;
      when my dancing and dressing-up and reciting have palled on him; then it
      may be a good thing to have something in reserve--[Breaking off.] What nonsense! That time
      will never come. Now, what do you think of my great secret, Christine? Do
      you still think I am of no use? I can tell you, too, that this affair has
      caused me a lot of worry. It has been by no means easy for me to meet my
      engagements punctually. I may tell you that there is something that is
      called, in business, quarterly interest, and another thing called payment
      in installments, and it is always so dreadfully difficult to manage them.
      I have had to save a little here and there, where I could, you understand.
      I have not been able to put aside much from my housekeeping money, for
      Torvald must have a good table. I couldn't let my children be shabbily
      dressed; I have felt obliged to use up all he gave me for them, the sweet
      little darlings!
    ,Nora ,[meditatively,
      and with a half smile],[Breaking off.],
      Mrs Linde. So it has all had to come out of
      your own necessaries of life, poor Nora?
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Nora. Of course. Besides, I was the one
      responsible for it. Whenever Torvald has given me money for new dresses
      and such things, I have never spent more than half of it; I have always
      bought the simplest and cheapest things. Thank Heaven, any clothes look
      well on me, and so Torvald has never noticed it. But it was often very
      hard on me, Christine--because it is delightful to be really well dressed,
      isn't it?
    ,Nora,
      Mrs Linde. Quite so.
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Nora. Well, then I have found other ways of
      earning money. Last winter I was lucky enough to get a lot of copying to
      do; so I locked myself up and sat writing every evening until quite late
      at night. Many a time I was desperately tired; but all the same it was a
      tremendous pleasure to sit there working and earning money. It was like
      being a man.
    ,Nora,
      Mrs Linde. How much have you been able to
      pay off in that way?
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Nora. I can't tell you exactly. You see, it
      is very difficult to keep an account of a business matter of that kind. I
      only know that I have paid every penny that I could scrape together. Many
      a time I was at my wits' end. [Smiles.]
      Then I used to sit here and imagine that a rich old gentleman had fallen
      in love with me--
    ,Nora,[Smiles.],
      Mrs Linde. What! Who was it?
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Nora. Be quiet!--that he had died; and that
      when his will was opened it contained, written in big letters, the
      instruction: "The lovely Mrs Nora Helmer is to have all I possess paid
      over to her at once in cash."
    ,Nora,
      Mrs Linde. But, my dear Nora--who could the
      man be?
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Nora. Good gracious, can't you understand?
      There was no old gentleman at all; it was only something that I used to
      sit here and imagine, when I couldn't think of any way of procuring money.
      But it's all the same now; the tiresome old person can stay where he is,
      as far as I am concerned; I don't care about him or his will either, for I
      am free from care now. [Jumps up.] My
      goodness, it's delightful to think of, Christine! Free from care! To be
      able to be free from care, quite free from care; to be able to play and
      romp with the children; to be able to keep the house beautifully and have
      everything just as Torvald likes it! And, think of it, soon the spring
      will come and the big blue sky! Perhaps we shall be able to take a little
      trip--perhaps I shall see the sea again! Oh, it's a wonderful thing to be
      alive and be happy. [A bell is heard in the
      hall.]
    ,Nora,[Jumps up.],[A bell is heard in the
      hall.],
      Mrs Linde [rising].
      There is the bell; perhaps I had better go.
    ,Mrs Linde,[rising],
      Nora. No, don't go; no one will come in
      here; it is sure to be for Torvald.
    ,Nora,
      Servant [at
      the hall door]. Excuse me, ma'am--there is a gentleman to see the
      master, and as the doctor is with him--
    ,Servant ,[at
      the hall door],
      Nora. Who is it?
    ,Nora,
      Krogstad [at
      the door]. It is I, Mrs Helmer. [Mrs
      LINDE starts, trembles, and turns to the window.]
    ,Krogstad ,[at
      the door],[Mrs
      LINDE starts, trembles, and turns to the window.],
      Nora [takes a
      step towards him, and speaks in a strained, low voice]. You? What
      is it? What do you want to see my husband about?
    ,Nora ,[takes a
      step towards him, and speaks in a strained, low voice],
      Krogstad. Bank business--in a way. I have a
      small post in the Bank, and I hear your husband is to be our chief now--
    ,Krogstad,
      Nora. Then it is--
    ,Nora,
      Krogstad. Nothing but dry business matters,
      Mrs Helmer; absolutely nothing else.
    ,Krogstad,
      Nora. Be so good as to go into the study,
      then. [She bows indifferently to him and
      shuts the door into the hall; then comes back and makes up the fire in the
      stove.]
    ,Nora,[She bows indifferently to him and
      shuts the door into the hall; then comes back and makes up the fire in the
      stove.],
      Mrs Linde. Nora--who was that man?
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Nora. A lawyer, of the name of Krogstad.
    ,Nora,
      Mrs Linde. Then it really was he.
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Nora. Do you know the man?
    ,Nora,
      Mrs Linde. I used to--many years ago. At
      one time he was a solicitor's clerk in our town.
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Nora. Yes, he was.
    ,Nora,
      Mrs Linde. He is greatly altered.
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Nora. He made a very unhappy marriage.
    ,Nora,
      Mrs Linde. He is a widower now, isn't he?
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Nora. With several children. There now, it
      is burning up. [Shuts the door of the stove and moves the rocking-chair
      aside.]
    ,Nora,
      Mrs Linde. They say he carries on various
      kinds of business.
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Nora. Really! Perhaps he does; I don't know
      anything about it. But don't let us think of business; it is so tiresome.
    ,Nora,
      Doctor Rank [comes
      out of HELMER'S study. Before he shuts the door he calls to him].
      No, my dear fellow, I won't disturb you; I would rather go in to your wife
      for a little while. [Shuts the door and sees
      Mrs LINDE.] I beg your pardon; I am afraid I am disturbing you too.
    ,Doctor Rank ,[comes
      out of HELMER'S study. Before he shuts the door he calls to him],[Shuts the door and sees
      Mrs LINDE.],
      Nora. No, not at all. [Introducing him]. Doctor Rank, Mrs Linde.
    ,Nora,[Introducing him],
      Rank. I have often heard Mrs Linde's name
      mentioned here. I think I passed you on the stairs when I arrived, Mrs
      Linde?
    ,Rank,
      Mrs Linde. Yes, I go up very slowly; I
      can't manage stairs well.
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Rank. Ah! some slight internal weakness?
    ,Rank,
      Mrs Linde. No, the fact is I have been
      overworking myself.
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Rank. Nothing more than that? Then I
      suppose you have come to town to amuse yourself with our entertainments?
    ,Rank,
      Mrs Linde. I have come to look for work.
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Rank. Is that a good cure for overwork?
    ,Rank,
      Mrs Linde. One must live, Doctor Rank.
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Rank. Yes, the general opinion seems to be
      that it is necessary.
    ,Rank,
      Nora. Look here, Doctor Rank--you know you
      want to live.
    ,Nora,
      Rank. Certainly. However wretched I may
      feel, I want to prolong the agony as long as possible. All my patients are
      like that. And so are those who are morally diseased; one of them, and a
      bad case too, is at this very moment with Helmer--
    ,Rank,
      Mrs Linde [sadly].
      Ah!
    ,Mrs Linde,[sadly],
      Nora. Whom do you mean?
    ,Nora,
      Rank. A lawyer of the name of Krogstad, a
      fellow you don't know at all. He suffers from a diseased moral character,
      Mrs Helmer; but even he began talking of its being highly important that
      he should live.
    ,Rank,
      Nora. Did he? What did he want to speak to
      Torvald about?
    ,Nora,
      Rank. I have no idea; I only heard that it
      was something about the Bank.
    ,Rank,
      Nora. I didn't know this--what's his
      name--Krogstad had anything to do with the Bank.
    ,Nora,
      Rank. Yes, he has some sort of appointment
      there. [To Mrs Linde.] I don't know
      whether you find also in your part of the world that there are certain
      people who go zealously snuffing about to smell out moral corruption, and,
      as soon as they have found some, put the person concerned into some
      lucrative position where they can keep their eye on him. Healthy natures
      are left out in the cold.
    ,Rank,[To Mrs Linde.],
      Mrs Linde. Still I think the sick are those
      who most need taking care of.
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Rank [shrugging
      his shoulders]. Yes, there you are. That is the sentiment that is
      turning Society into a sick-house.
    ,Rank ,[shrugging
      his shoulders],
      [NORA, who has been absorbed in her
      thoughts, breaks out into smothered laughter and claps her hands.]
    ,[NORA, who has been absorbed in her
      thoughts, breaks out into smothered laughter and claps her hands.],
      Rank. Why do you laugh at that? Have you
      any notion what Society really is?
    ,Rank,
      Nora. What do I care about tiresome
      Society? I am laughing at something quite different, something extremely
      amusing. Tell me, Doctor Rank, are all the people who are employed in the
      Bank dependent on Torvald now?
    ,Nora,
      Rank. Is that what you find so extremely
      amusing?
    ,Rank,
      Nora [smiling
      and humming]. That's my affair! [Walking
      about the room.] It's perfectly glorious to think that we
      have--that Torvald has so much power over so many people. [Takes the packet from her pocket.] Doctor
      Rank, what do you say to a macaroon?
    ,Nora ,[smiling
      and humming],[Walking
      about the room.],[Takes the packet from her pocket.],
      Rank. What, macaroons? I thought they were
      forbidden here.
    ,Rank,
      Nora. Yes, but these are some Christine
      gave me.
    ,Nora,
      Mrs Linde. What! I?--
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Nora. Oh, well, don't be alarmed! You
      couldn't know that Torvald had forbidden them. I must tell you that he is
      afraid they will spoil my teeth. But, bah!--once in a way--That's so,
      isn't it, Doctor Rank? By your leave! [Puts
      a macaroon into his mouth.] You must have one too, Christine. And I
      shall have one, just a little one--or at most two. [Walking about.] I am tremendously happy.
      There is just one thing in the world now that I should dearly love to do.
    ,Nora,[Puts
      a macaroon into his mouth.],[Walking about.],
      Rank. Well, what is that?
    ,Rank,
      Nora. It's something I should dearly love
      to say, if Torvald could hear me.
    ,Nora,
      Rank. Well, why can't you say it?
    ,Rank,
      Nora. No, I daren't; it's so shocking.
    ,Nora,
      Mrs Linde. Shocking?
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Rank. Well, I should not advise you to say
      it. Still, with us you might. What is it you would so much like to say if
      Torvald could hear you?
    ,Rank,
      Nora. I should just love to say--Well, I'm
      damned!
    ,Nora,
      Rank. Are you mad?
    ,Rank,
      Mrs Linde. Nora, dear--!
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Rank. Say it, here he is!
    ,Rank,
      Nora [hiding
      the packet]. Hush! Hush! Hush! [HELMER
      comes out of his room, with his coat over his arm and his hat in his hand.]
    ,Nora ,[hiding
      the packet],[HELMER
      comes out of his room, with his coat over his arm and his hat in his hand.],
      Nora. Well, Torvald dear, have you got rid
      of him?
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. Yes, he has just gone.
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. Let me introduce you--this is
      Christine, who has come to town.
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. Christine--? Excuse me, but I don't
      know--
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. Mrs Linde, dear; Christine Linde.
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. Of course. A school friend of my
      wife's, I presume?
    ,Helmer,
      Mrs Linde. Yes, we have known each other
      since then.
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Nora. And just think, she has taken a long
      journey in order to see you.
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. What do you mean?
    ,Helmer,
      Mrs Linde. No, really, I--
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Nora. Christine is tremendously clever at
      book-keeping, and she is frightfully anxious to work under some clever
      man, so as to perfect herself--
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. Very sensible, Mrs Linde.
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. And when she heard you had been
      appointed manager of the Bank--the news was telegraphed, you know--she
      travelled here as quick as she could. Torvald, I am sure you will be able
      to do something for Christine, for my sake, won't you?
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. Well, it is not altogether
      impossible. I presume you are a widow, Mrs Linde?
    ,Helmer,
      Mrs Linde. Yes.
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Helmer. And have had some experience of
      book-keeping?
    ,Helmer,
      Mrs Linde. Yes, a fair amount.
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Helmer. Ah! well, it's very likely I may be
      able to find something for you--
    ,Helmer,
      Nora [clapping
      her hands]. What did I tell you? What did I tell you?
    ,Nora ,[clapping
      her hands],
      Helmer. You have just come at a fortunate
      moment, Mrs Linde.
    ,Helmer,
      Mrs Linde. How am I to thank you?
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Helmer. There is no need. [Puts on his coat.] But today you must
      excuse me--
    ,Helmer,[Puts on his coat.],
      Rank. Wait a minute; I will come with you.
      [Brings his fur coat from the hall and warms
      it at the fire.]
    ,Rank,[Brings his fur coat from the hall and warms
      it at the fire.],
      Nora. Don't be long away, Torvald dear.
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. About an hour, not more.
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. Are you going too, Christine?
    ,Nora,
      Mrs Linde [putting
      on her cloak]. Yes, I must go and look for a room.
    ,Mrs Linde,[putting
      on her cloak],
      Helmer. Oh, well then, we can walk down the
      street together.
    ,Helmer,
      Nora [helping
      her]. What a pity it is we are so short of space here; I am afraid
      it is impossible for us--
    ,Nora ,[helping
      her],
      Mrs Linde. Please don't think of it!
      Goodbye, Nora dear, and many thanks.
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Nora. Goodbye for the present. Of course
      you will come back this evening. And you too, Dr. Rank. What do you say?
      If you are well enough? Oh, you must be! Wrap yourself up well. [They go to the door all talking together.
      Children's voices are heard on the staircase.]
    ,Nora,[They go to the door all talking together.
      Children's voices are heard on the staircase.],
      Nora. There they are! There they are! [She runs to open the door. The NURSE comes in
      with the children.] Come in! Come in! [Stoops
      and kisses them.] Oh, you sweet blessings! Look at them, Christine!
      Aren't they darlings?
    ,Nora,[She runs to open the door. The NURSE comes in
      with the children.],[Stoops
      and kisses them.],
      Rank. Don't let us stand here in the
      draught.
    ,Rank,
      Helmer. Come along, Mrs Linde; the place
      will only be bearable for a mother now!
    ,Helmer,
      [RANK, HELMER, and Mrs Linde go downstairs.
      The NURSE comes forward with the children; NORA shuts the hall door.]
    ,[RANK, HELMER, and Mrs Linde go downstairs.
      The NURSE comes forward with the children; NORA shuts the hall door.],
      Nora. How fresh and well you look! Such red
      cheeks like apples and roses. [The children
      all talk at once while she speaks to them.] Have you had great fun?
      That's splendid! What, you pulled both Emmy and Bob along on the sledge?
      --both at once?--that was good. You are a clever boy, Ivar. Let me take
      her for a little, Anne. My sweet little baby doll! [Takes the baby from the MAID and dances it up and
      down.] Yes, yes, mother will dance with Bob too. What! Have you
      been snowballing? I wish I had been there too! No, no, I will take their
      things off, Anne; please let me do it, it is such fun. Go in now, you look
      half frozen. There is some hot coffee for you on the stove.
    ,Nora,[The children
      all talk at once while she speaks to them.],[Takes the baby from the MAID and dances it up and
      down.],
      [The NURSE goes into the room on the left.

      talk to her at once.]
    ,[The NURSE goes into the room on the left.
      NORA takes off the children's things and throws them about, while they all
      talk to her at once.],
      Nora. Really! Did a big dog run after you?
      But it didn't bite you? No, dogs don't bite nice little dolly children.
      You mustn't look at the parcels, Ivar. What are they? Ah, I daresay you
      would like to know. No, no--it's something nasty! Come, let us have a
      game! What shall we play at? Hide and Seek? Yes, we'll play Hide and Seek.
      Bob shall hide first. Must I hide? Very well, I'll hide first. [She and the children laugh and shout, and romp in
      and out of the room; at last NORA hides under the table, the children rush
      in and out for her, but do not see her; they hear her smothered laughter,
      run to the table, lift up the cloth and find her. Shouts of laughter. She
      crawls forward and pretends to frighten them. Fresh laughter. Meanwhile
      there has been a knock at the hall door, but none of them has noticed it.
      The door is half opened, and KROGSTAD appears, he waits a little; the
      game goes on.]

      Krogstad. Excuse me, Mrs Helmer.
    ,Krogstad,
      Nora [with a
      stifled cry, turns round and gets up on to her knees]. Ah! what do
      you want?
    ,Nora ,[with a
      stifled cry, turns round and gets up on to her knees],
      Krogstad. Excuse me, the outer door was
      ajar; I suppose someone forgot to shut it.
    ,Krogstad,
      Nora [rising].
      My husband is out, Mr. Krogstad.
    ,Nora ,[rising],
      Krogstad. I know that.
    ,Krogstad,
      Nora. What do you want here, then?
    ,Nora,
      Krogstad. A word with you.
    ,Krogstad,
      Nora. With me?--[To the children, gently.] Go in to nurse.
      What? No, the strange man won't do mother any harm. When he has gone we
      will have another game. [She takes the
      children into the room on the left, and shuts the door after them.]
      You want to speak to me?
    ,Nora,[To the children, gently.],[She takes the
      children into the room on the left, and shuts the door after them.],
      Krogstad. Yes, I do.
    ,Krogstad,
      Nora. Today? It is not the first of the
      month yet.
    ,Nora,
      Krogstad. No, it is Christmas Eve, and it
      will depend on yourself what sort of a Christmas you will spend.
    ,Krogstad,
      Nora. What do you mean? Today it is
      absolutely impossible for me--
    ,Nora,
      Krogstad. We won't talk about that until
      later on. This is something different. I presume you can give me a moment?
    ,Krogstad,
      Nora. Yes--yes, I can--although--
    ,Nora,
      Krogstad. Good. I was in Olsen's Restaurant
      and saw your husband going down the street--
    ,Krogstad,
      Nora. Yes?
    ,Nora,
      Krogstad. With a lady.
    ,Krogstad,
      Nora. What then?
    ,Nora,
      Krogstad. May I make so bold as to ask if
      it was a Mrs Linde?
    ,Krogstad,
      Nora. It was.
    ,Nora,
      Krogstad. Just arrived in town?
    ,Krogstad,
      Nora. Yes, today.
    ,Nora,
      Krogstad. She is a great friend of yours,
      isn't she?
    ,Krogstad,
      Nora. She is. But I don't see--
    ,Nora,
      Krogstad. I knew her too, once upon a time.
    ,Krogstad,
      Nora. I am aware of that.
    ,Nora,
      Krogstad. Are you? So you know all about
      it; I thought as much. Then I can ask you, without beating about the
      bush--is Mrs Linde to have an appointment in the Bank?
    ,Krogstad,
      Nora. What right have you to question me,
      Mr. Krogstad?--You, one of my husband's subordinates! But since you ask,
      you shall know. Yes, Mrs Linde is to have an appointment. And it was I who
      pleaded her cause, Mr. Krogstad, let me tell you that.
    ,Nora,
      Krogstad. I was right in what I thought,
      then.
    ,Krogstad,
      Nora [walking
      up and down the stage]. Sometimes one has a tiny little bit of
      influence, I should hope. Because one is a woman, it does not necessarily
      follow that--. When anyone is in a subordinate position, Mr. Krogstad,
      they should really be careful to avoid offending anyone who--who--
    ,Nora ,[walking
      up and down the stage],
      Krogstad. Who has influence?
    ,Krogstad,
      Nora. Exactly.
    ,Nora,
      Krogstad [changing
      his tone]. Mrs Helmer, you will be so good as to use your influence
      on my behalf.
    ,Krogstad ,[changing
      his tone],
      Nora. What? What do you mean?
    ,Nora,
      Krogstad. You will be so kind as to see
      that I am allowed to keep my subordinate position in the Bank.
    ,Krogstad,
      Nora. What do you mean by that? Who
      proposes to take your post away from you?
    ,Nora,
      Krogstad. Oh, there is no necessity to keep
      up the pretence of ignorance. I can quite understand that your friend is
      not very anxious to expose herself to the chance of rubbing shoulders with
      me; and I quite understand, too, whom I have to thank for being turned
      off.
    ,Krogstad,
      Nora. But I assure you--
    ,Nora,
      Krogstad. Very likely; but, to come to the
      point, the time has come when I should advise you to use your influence to
      prevent that.
    ,Krogstad,
      Nora. But, Mr. Krogstad, I have no
      influence.
    ,Nora,
      Krogstad. Haven't you? I thought you said
      yourself just now--
    ,Krogstad,
      Nora. Naturally I did not mean you to put
      that construction on it. I! What should make you think I have any
      influence of that kind with my husband?
    ,Nora,
      Krogstad. Oh, I have known your husband
      from our student days. I don't suppose he is any more unassailable than
      other husbands.
    ,Krogstad,
      Nora. If you speak slightingly of my
      husband, I shall turn you out of the house.
    ,Nora,
      Krogstad. You are bold, Mrs Helmer.
    ,Krogstad,
      Nora. I am not afraid of you any longer. As
      soon as the New Year comes, I shall in a very short time be free of the
      whole thing.
    ,Nora,
      Krogstad [controlling
      himself]. Listen to me, Mrs Helmer. If necessary, I am prepared to
      fight for my small post in the Bank as if I were fighting for my life.
    ,Krogstad ,[controlling
      himself],
      Nora. So it seems.
    ,Nora,
      Krogstad. It is not only for the sake of
      the money; indeed, that weighs least with me in the matter. There is
      another reason--well, I may as well tell you. My position is this. I
      daresay you know, like everybody else, that once, many years ago, I was
      guilty of an indiscretion.
    ,Krogstad,
      Nora. I think I have heard something of the
      kind.
    ,Nora,
      Krogstad. The matter never came into court;
      but every way seemed to be closed to me after that. So I took to the
      business that you know of. I had to do something; and, honestly, I don't
      think I've been one of the worst. But now I must cut myself free from all
      that. My sons are growing up; for their sake I must try and win back as
      much respect as I can in the town. This post in the Bank was like the
      first step up for me--and now your husband is going to kick me downstairs
      again into the mud.
    ,Krogstad,
      Nora. But you must believe me, Mr.
      Krogstad; it is not in my power to help you at all.
    ,Nora,
      Krogstad. Then it is because you haven't
      the will; but I have means to compel you.
    ,Krogstad,
      Nora. You don't mean that you will tell my
      husband that I owe you money?
    ,Nora,
      Krogstad. Hm!--suppose I were to tell him?
    ,Krogstad,
      Nora. It would be perfectly infamous of
      you. [Sobbing.] To think of his
      learning my secret, which has been my joy and pride, in such an ugly,
      clumsy way--that he should learn it from you! And it would put me in a
      horribly disagreeable position--
    ,Nora,[Sobbing.],
      Krogstad. Only disagreeable?
    ,Krogstad,
      Nora [impetuously].
      Well, do it, then!--and it will be the worse for you. My husband will see
      for himself what a blackguard you are, and you certainly won't keep your
      post then.
    ,Nora ,[impetuously],
      Krogstad. I asked you if it was only a
      disagreeable scene at home that you were afraid of?
    ,Krogstad,
      Nora. If my husband does get to know of it,
      of course he will at once pay you what is still owing, and we shall have
      nothing more to do with you.
    ,Nora,
      Krogstad [coming
      a step nearer]. Listen to me, Mrs Helmer. Either you have a very
      bad memory or you know very little of business. I shall be obliged to
      remind you of a few details.
    ,Krogstad ,[coming
      a step nearer],
      Nora. What do you mean?
    ,Nora,
      Krogstad. When your husband was ill, you
      came to me to borrow two hundred and fifty pounds.
    ,Krogstad,
      Nora. I didn't know anyone else to go to.
    ,Nora,
      Krogstad. I promised to get you that
      amount--
    ,Krogstad,
      Nora. Yes, and you did so.
    ,Nora,
      Krogstad. I promised to get you that
      amount, on certain conditions. Your mind was so taken up with your
      husband's illness, and you were so anxious to get the money for your
      journey, that you seem to have paid no attention to the conditions of our
      bargain. Therefore it will not be amiss if I remind you of them. Now, I
      promised to get the money on the security of a bond which I drew up.
    ,Krogstad,
      Nora. Yes, and which I signed.
    ,Nora,
      Krogstad. Good. But below your signature
      there were a few lines constituting your father a surety for the money;
      those lines your father should have signed.
    ,Krogstad,
      Nora. Should? He did sign them.
    ,Nora,
      Krogstad. I had left the date blank; that
      is to say, your father should himself have inserted the date on which he
      signed the paper. Do you remember that?
    ,Krogstad,
      Nora. Yes, I think I remember--
    ,Nora,
      Krogstad. Then I gave you the bond to send
      by post to your father. Is that not so?
    ,Krogstad,
      Nora. Yes.
    ,Nora,
      Krogstad. And you naturally did so at once,
      because five or six days afterwards you brought me the bond with your
      father's signature. And then I gave you the money.
    ,Krogstad,
      Nora. Well, haven't I been paying it off
      regularly?
    ,Nora,
      Krogstad. Fairly so, yes. But--to come back
      to the matter in hand--that must have been a very trying time for you, Mrs
      Helmer?
    ,Krogstad,
      Nora. It was, indeed.
    ,Nora,
      Krogstad. Your father was very ill, wasn't
      he?
    ,Krogstad,
      Nora. He was very near his end.
    ,Nora,
      Krogstad. And died soon afterwards?
    ,Krogstad,
      Nora. Yes.
    ,Nora,
      Krogstad. Tell me, Mrs Helmer, can you by
      any chance remember what day your father died?--on what day of the month,
      I mean.
    ,Krogstad,
      Nora. Papa died on the 29th of September.
    ,Nora,
      Krogstad. That is correct; I have
      ascertained it for myself. And, as that is so, there is a discrepancy
      [taking a paper from his pocket]
      which I cannot account for.
    ,Krogstad,[taking a paper from his pocket],
      Nora. What discrepancy? I don't know--
    ,Nora,
      Krogstad. The discrepancy consists, Mrs
      Helmer, in the fact that your father signed this bond three days after his
      death.
    ,Krogstad,
      Nora. What do you mean? I don't
      understand--
    ,Nora,
      Krogstad. Your father died on the 29th of
      September. But, look here; your father has dated his signature the 2nd of
      October. It is a discrepancy, isn't it? [NORA
      is silent.] Can you explain it to me? [NORA
      is still silent.] It is a remarkable thing, too, that the words
      "2nd of October," as well as the year, are not written in your father's
      handwriting but in one that I think I know. Well, of course it can be
      explained; your father may have forgotten to date his signature, and
      someone else may have dated it haphazard before they knew of his death.
      There is no harm in that. It all depends on the signature of the name; and
      that is genuine, I suppose, Mrs Helmer? It was your father himself who
      signed his name here?
    ,Krogstad,[NORA
      is silent.],[NORA
      is still silent.],
      Nora [after a
      short pause, throws her head up and looks defiantly at him]. No, it
      was not. It was I that wrote papa's name.
    ,Nora ,[after a
      short pause, throws her head up and looks defiantly at him],
      Krogstad. Are you aware that is a dangerous
      confession?
    ,Krogstad,
      Nora. In what way? You shall have your
      money soon.
    ,Nora,
      Krogstad. Let me ask you a question; why
      did you not send the paper to your father?
    ,Krogstad,
      Nora. It was impossible; papa was so ill.
      If I had asked him for his signature, I should have had to tell him what
      the money was to be used for; and when he was so ill himself I couldn't
      tell him that my husband's life was in danger--it was impossible.
    ,Nora,
      Krogstad. It would have been better for you
      if you had given up your trip abroad.
    ,Krogstad,
      Nora. No, that was impossible. That trip
      was to save my husband's life; I couldn't give that up.
    ,Nora,
      Krogstad. But did it never occur to you
      that you were committing a fraud on me?
    ,Krogstad,
      Nora. I couldn't take that into account; I
      didn't trouble myself about you at all. I couldn't bear you, because you
      put so many heartless difficulties in my way, although you knew what a
      dangerous condition my husband was in.
    ,Nora,
      Krogstad. Mrs Helmer, you evidently do not
      realise clearly what it is that you have been guilty of. But I can assure
      you that my one false step, which lost me all my reputation, was nothing
      more or nothing worse than what you have done.
    ,Krogstad,
      Nora. You? Do you ask me to believe that
      you were brave enough to run a risk to save your wife's life?
    ,Nora,
      Krogstad. The law cares nothing about
      motives.
    ,Krogstad,
      Nora. Then it must be a very foolish law.
    ,Nora,
      Krogstad. Foolish or not, it is the law by
      which you will be judged, if I produce this paper in court.
    ,Krogstad,
      Nora. I don't believe it. Is a daughter not
      to be allowed to spare her dying father anxiety and care? Is a wife not to
      be allowed to save her husband's life? I don't know much about law; but I
      am certain that there must be laws permitting such things as that. Have
      you no knowledge of such laws--you who are a lawyer? You must be a very
      poor lawyer, Mr. Krogstad.
    ,Nora,
      Krogstad. Maybe. But matters of
      business--such business as you and I have had together--do you think I
      don't understand that? Very well. Do as you please. But let me tell you
      this--if I lose my position a second time, you shall lose yours with me.

      Nora [appears
      buried in thought for a short time, then tosses her head].
      Nonsense! Trying to frighten me like that!--I am not so silly as he
      thinks. [Begins to busy herself putting the
      children's things in order.] And yet--? No, it's impossible! I did
      it for love's sake.

      Nora. Yes, dears, I know. But, don't tell
      anyone about the stranger man. Do you hear? Not even papa.
    ,Nora,
      Children. No, mother; but will you come and
      play again?
    ,Children,
      Nora. No, no,--not now.
    ,Nora,
      Children. But, mother, you promised us.
    ,Children,
      Nora. Yes, but I can't now. Run away in; I
      have such a lot to do. Run away in, my sweet little darlings. [She gets them into the room by degrees and shuts
      the door on them; then sits down on the sofa, takes up a piece of
      needlework and sews a few stitches, but soon stops.] No! [Throws down the work, gets up, goes to the hall

      Nora. Here, in the middle of the floor.
    ,Nora,
      Maid. Shall I get you anything else?

      Nora. No, thank you. I have all I want.
      [Exit MAID.]

      man! It's all nonsense--there's nothing wrong. The tree shall be splendid!
      I will do everything I can think of to please you, Torvald!--I will sing
      for you, dance for you--[HELMER comes in
      with some papers under his arm.] Oh! are you back already?
    ,Nora ,[begins
      dressing the tree],[HELMER comes in
      with some papers under his arm.],
      Helmer. Yes. Has anyone been here?
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. Here? No.
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. That is strange. I saw Krogstad
      going out of the gate.
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. Did you? Oh yes, I forgot, Krogstad
      was here for a moment.
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. Nora, I can see from your manner
      that he has been here begging you to say a good word for him.
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. Yes.
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. And you were to appear to do it of
      your own accord; you were to conceal from me the fact of his having been
      here; didn't he beg that of you too?
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. Yes, Torvald, but--
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. Nora, Nora, and you would be a
      party to that sort of thing? To have any talk with a man like that, and
      give him any sort of promise? And to tell me a lie into the bargain?
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. A lie--?
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. Didn't you tell me no one had been
      here? [Shakes his finger at her.] My
      little songbird must never do that again. A songbird must have a clean
      beak to chirp with--no false notes! [Puts
      his arm round her waist.] That is so, isn't it? Yes, I am sure it
      is. [Lets her go.] We will say no
      more about it. [Sits down by the stove.]
      How warm and snug it is here! [Turns over

      Torvald!
    ,Nora ,[after a
      short pause, during which she busies herself with the Christmas Tree.],
      Helmer. Yes.
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. I am looking forward tremendously to
      the fancy-dress ball at the Stenborgs' the day after tomorrow.
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. And I am tremendously curious to
      see what you are going to surprise me with.
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. It was very silly of me to want to do
      that.
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. What do you mean?
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. I can't hit upon anything that will
      do; everything I think of seems so silly and insignificant.
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. Does my little Nora acknowledge
      that at last?
    ,Helmer,
      Nora [standing
      behind his chair with her arms on the back of it]. Are you very
      busy, Torvald?
    ,Nora ,[standing
      behind his chair with her arms on the back of it],
      Helmer. Well--
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. What are all those papers?
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. Bank business.
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. Already?
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. I have got authority from the
      retiring manager to undertake the necessary changes in the staff and in
      the rearrangement of the work; and I must make use of the Christmas week
      for that, so as to have everything in order for the new year.
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. Then that was why this poor
      Krogstad--
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. Hm!
    ,Helmer,
      Nora [leans
      against the back of his chair and strokes his hair]. If you hadn't
      been so busy I should have asked you a tremendously big favour, Torvald.
    ,Nora ,[leans
      against the back of his chair and strokes his hair],
      Helmer. What is that? Tell me.
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. There is no one has such good taste
      as you. And I do so want to look nice at the fancy-dress ball. Torvald,
      couldn't you take me in hand and decide what I shall go as, and what sort
      of a dress I shall wear?
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. Aha! so my obstinate little woman
      is obliged to get someone to come to her rescue?
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. Yes, Torvald, I can't get along a bit
      without your help.
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. Very well, I will think it over, we
      shall manage to hit upon something.
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. That is nice of you. [Goes to the Christmas Tree. A short pause.]
      How pretty the red flowers look--. But, tell me, was it really something
      very bad that this Krogstad was guilty of?
    ,Nora,[Goes to the Christmas Tree. A short pause.],
      Helmer. He forged someone's name. Have you
      any idea what that means?
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. Isn't it possible that he was driven
      to do it by necessity?
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. Yes; or, as in so many cases, by
      imprudence. I am not so heartless as to condemn a man altogether because
      of a single false step of that kind.
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. No, you wouldn't, would you, Torvald?
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. Many a man has been able to
      retrieve his character, if he has openly confessed his fault and taken his
      punishment.
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. Punishment--?
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. But Krogstad did nothing of that
      sort; he got himself out of it by a cunning trick, and that is why he has
      gone under altogether.
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. But do you think it would--?
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. Just think how a guilty man like
      that has to lie and play the hypocrite with every one, how he has to wear
      a mask in the presence of those near and dear to him, even before his own
      wife and children. And about the children--that is the most terrible part
      of it all, Nora.
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. How?
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. Because such an atmosphere of lies
      infects and poisons the whole life of a home. Each breath the children
      take in such a house is full of the germs of evil.
    ,Helmer,
      Nora [coming
      nearer him]. Are you sure of that?
    ,Nora ,[coming
      nearer him],
      Helmer. My dear, I have often seen it in
      the course of my life as a lawyer. Almost everyone who has gone to the bad
      early in life has had a deceitful mother.
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. Why do you only say--mother?
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. It seems most commonly to be the
      mother's influence, though naturally a bad father's would have the same
      result. Every lawyer is familiar with the fact. This Krogstad, now, has
      been persistently poisoning his own children with lies and dissimulation;
      that is why I say he has lost all moral character. [Holds out his hands to her.] That is why
      my sweet little Nora must promise me not to plead his cause. Give me your
      hand on it. Come, come, what is this? Give me your hand. There now, that's
      settled. I assure you it would be quite impossible for me to work with
      him; I literally feel physically ill when I am in the company of such
      people.
    ,Helmer,[Holds out his hands to her.],
      Nora [takes
      her hand out of his and goes to the opposite side of the Christmas Tree].
      How hot it is in here; and I have such a lot to do.
    ,Nora ,[takes
      her hand out of his and goes to the opposite side of the Christmas Tree],
      Helmer [getting
      up and putting his papers in order]. Yes, and I must try and read
      through some of these before dinner; and I must think about your costume,
      too. And it is just possible I may have something ready in gold paper to
      hang up on the Tree. [Puts his hand on her
      head.] My precious little singing-bird! [He goes into his room and shuts the door after

      Nora. I should like to tear it into a
      hundred thousand pieces.
    ,Nora,
      Nurse. What an idea! It can easily be put
      in order--just a little patience.
    ,Nurse,
      Nora. Yes, I will go and get Mrs Linde to
      come and help me with it.
    ,Nora,
      Nurse. What, out again? In this horrible
      weather? You will catch cold, ma'am, and make yourself ill.
    ,Nurse,
      Nora. Well, worse than that might happen.
      How are the children?
    ,Nora,
      Nurse. The poor little souls are playing
      with their Christmas presents, but--
    ,Nurse,
      Nora. Do they ask much for me?
    ,Nora,
      Nurse. You see, they are so accustomed to
      have their mamma with them.
    ,Nurse,
      Nora. Yes, but, nurse, I shall not be able
      to be so much with them now as I was before.
    ,Nora,
      Nurse. Oh well, young children easily get
      accustomed to anything.
    ,Nurse,
      Nora. Do you think so? Do you think they
      would forget their mother if she went away altogether?
    ,Nora,
      Nurse. Good heavens!--went away altogether?
    ,Nurse,
      Nora. Nurse, I want you to tell me
      something I have often wondered about--how could you have the heart to put
      your own child out among strangers?
    ,Nora,
      Nurse. I was obliged to, if I wanted to be
      little Nora's nurse.
    ,Nurse,
      Nora. Yes, but how could you be willing to
      do it?
    ,Nora,
      Nurse. What, when I was going to get such a
      good place by it? A poor girl who has got into trouble should be glad to.
      Besides, that wicked man didn't do a single thing for me.
    ,Nurse,
      Nora. But I suppose your daughter has quite
      forgotten you.
    ,Nora,
      Nurse. No, indeed she hasn't. She wrote to
      me when she was confirmed, and when she was married.
    ,Nurse,
      Nora [putting
      her arms round her neck]. Dear old Anne, you were a good mother to
      me when I was little.

      mother, I am sure you would--What nonsense I am talking! [Opens the box.] Go in to them. Now I
      must--. You will see tomorrow how charming I shall look.

      Mrs Linde. I heard you were up asking for
      me.
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Nora. Yes, I was passing by. As a matter of
      fact, it is something you could help me with. Let us sit down here on the
      sofa. Look here. Tomorrow evening there is to be a fancy-dress ball at the
      Stenborgs', who live above us; and Torvald wants me to go as a Neapolitan
      fisher-girl, and dance the Tarantella that I learned at Capri.
    ,Nora,
      Mrs Linde. I see; you are going to keep up
      the character.
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Nora. Yes, Torvald wants me to. Look, here
      is the dress; Torvald had it made for me there, but now it is all so torn,
      and I haven't any idea--
    ,Nora,
      Mrs Linde. We will easily put that right.
      It is only some of the trimming come unsewn here and there. Needle and
      thread? Now then, that's all we want.
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Nora. It is nice of you.
    ,Nora,
      Mrs Linde [sewing].
      So you are going to be dressed up tomorrow Nora. I will tell you what--I
      shall come in for a moment and see you in your fine feathers. But I have
      completely forgotten to thank you for a delightful evening yesterday.
    ,Mrs Linde,[sewing],
      Nora [gets
      up, and crosses the stage]. Well, I don't think yesterday was as
      pleasant as usual. You ought to have come to town a little earlier,
      Christine. Certainly Torvald does understand how to make a house dainty
      and attractive.
    ,Nora ,[gets
      up, and crosses the stage],
      Mrs Linde. And so do you, it seems to me;
      you are not your father's daughter for nothing. But tell me, is Doctor
      Rank always as depressed as he was yesterday?
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Nora. No; yesterday it was very noticeable.
      I must tell you that he suffers from a very dangerous disease. He has
      consumption of the spine, poor creature. His father was a horrible man who
      committed all sorts of excesses; and that is why his son was sickly from
      childhood, do you understand?
    ,Nora,
      Mrs Linde [dropping
      her sewing]. But, my dearest Nora, how do you know anything about
      such things?
    ,Mrs Linde,[dropping
      her sewing],
      Nora [walking
      about]. Pooh! When you have three children, you get visits now and
      then from--from married women, who know something of medical matters, and
      they talk about one thing and another.
    ,Nora ,[walking
      about],
      Mrs Linde [goes
      on sewing. A short silence]. Does Doctor Rank come here everyday?
    ,Mrs Linde,[goes
      on sewing. A short silence],
      Nora. Everyday regularly. He is Torvald's
      most intimate friend, and a great friend of mine too. He is just like one
      of the family.
    ,Nora,
      Mrs Linde. But tell me this--is he
      perfectly sincere? I mean, isn't he the kind of man that is very anxious
      to make himself agreeable?
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Nora. Not in the least. What makes you
      think that?
    ,Nora,
      Mrs Linde. When you introduced him to me
      yesterday, he declared he had often heard my name mentioned in this house;
      but afterwards I noticed that your husband hadn't the slightest idea who I
      was. So how could Doctor Rank--?
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Nora. That is quite right, Christine.
      Torvald is so absurdly fond of me that he wants me absolutely to himself,
      as he says. At first he used to seem almost jealous if I mentioned any of
      the dear folk at home, so naturally I gave up doing so. But I often talk
      about such things with Doctor Rank, because he likes hearing about them.
    ,Nora,
      Mrs Linde. Listen to me, Nora. You are
      still very like a child in many things, and I am older than you in many
      ways and have a little more experience. Let me tell you this--you ought to
      make an end of it with Doctor Rank.
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Nora. What ought I to make an end of?
    ,Nora,
      Mrs Linde. Of two things, I think.
      Yesterday you talked some nonsense about a rich admirer who was to leave
      you money--
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Nora. An admirer who doesn't exist,
      unfortunately! But what then?
    ,Nora,
      Mrs Linde. Is Doctor Rank a man of means?
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Nora. Yes, he is.
    ,Nora,
      Mrs Linde. And has no one to provide for?
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Nora. No, no one; but--
    ,Nora,
      Mrs Linde. And comes here everyday?
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Nora. Yes, I told you so.
    ,Nora,
      Mrs Linde. But how can this well-bred man
      be so tactless?
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Nora. I don't understand you at all.
    ,Nora,
      Mrs Linde. Don't prevaricate, Nora. Do you
      suppose I don't guess who lent you the two hundred and fifty pounds?
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Nora. Are you out of your senses? How can
      you think of such a thing! A friend of ours, who comes here everyday! Do
      you realise what a horribly painful position that would be?
    ,Nora,
      Mrs Linde. Then it really isn't he?
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Nora. No, certainly not. It would never
      have entered into my head for a moment. Besides, he had no money to lend
      then; he came into his money afterwards.
    ,Nora,
      Mrs Linde. Well, I think that was lucky for
      you, my dear Nora.
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Nora. No, it would never have come into my
      head to ask Doctor Rank. Although I am quite sure that if I had asked
      him--
    ,Nora,
      Mrs Linde. But of course you won't.
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Nora. Of course not. I have no reason to
      think it could possibly be necessary. But I am quite sure that if I told
      Doctor Rank--
    ,Nora,
      Mrs Linde. Behind your husband's back?
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Nora. I must make an end of it with the
      other one, and that will be behind his back too. I must make an end of it
      with him.
    ,Nora,
      Mrs Linde. Yes, that is what I told you
      yesterday, but--
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Nora [walking
      up and down]. A man can put a thing like that straight much easier
      than a woman--
    ,Nora ,[walking
      up and down],
      Mrs Linde. One's husband, yes.
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Nora. Nonsense! [Standing still.] When you pay off a debt
      you get your bond back, don't you?
    ,Nora,[Standing still.],
      Mrs Linde. Yes, as a matter of course.
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Nora. And can tear it into a hundred
      thousand pieces, and burn it up--the nasty dirty paper!
    ,Nora,
      Mrs Linde [looks
      hard at her, lays down her sewing and gets up slowly]. Nora, you
      are concealing something from me.
    ,Mrs Linde,[looks
      hard at her, lays down her sewing and gets up slowly],
      Nora. Do I look as if I were?
    ,Nora,
      Mrs Linde. Something has happened to you
      since yesterday morning. Nora, what is it?
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Nora [going
      nearer to her]. Christine! [Listens.]
      Hush! there's Torvald come home. Do you mind going in to the children for
      the present? Torvald can't bear to see dressmaking going on. Let Anne help
      you.
    ,Nora ,[going
      nearer to her],[Listens.],
      Mrs Linde [gathering
      some of the things together]. Certainly--but I am not going away
      from here until we have had it out with one another. [She goes into the room on the left, as HELMER
      comes in from the hall.]
    ,Mrs Linde,[gathering
      some of the things together],[She goes into the room on the left, as HELMER
      comes in from the hall.],
      Nora [going
      up to HELMER]. I have wanted you so much, Torvald dear.
    ,Nora ,[going
      up to HELMER],
      Helmer. Was that the dressmaker?
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. No, it was Christine; she is helping
      me to put my dress in order. You will see I shall look quite smart.
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. Wasn't that a happy thought of
      mine, now?
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. Splendid! But don't you think it is
      nice of me, too, to do as you wish?
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. Nice?--because you do as your
      husband wishes? Well, well, you little rogue, I am sure you did not mean
      it in that way. But I am not going to disturb you; you will want to be
      trying on your dress, I expect.
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. I suppose you are going to work.
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. Yes. [Shows
      her a bundle of papers.] Look at that. I have just been into the
      bank. [Turns to go into his room.]
    ,Helmer,[Shows
      her a bundle of papers.],[Turns to go into his room.],
      Nora. Torvald.
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. Yes.
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. If your little squirrel were to ask
      you for something very, very prettily--?
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. What then?
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. Would you do it?
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. I should like to hear what it is,
      first.
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. Your squirrel would run about and do
      all her tricks if you would be nice, and do what she wants.
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. Speak plainly.
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. Your skylark would chirp about in
      every room, with her song rising and falling--
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. Well, my skylark does that anyhow.
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. I would play the fairy and dance for
      you in the moonlight, Torvald.
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. Nora--you surely don't mean that
      request you made to me this morning?
    ,Helmer,
      Nora [going
      near him]. Yes, Torvald, I beg you so earnestly--
    ,Nora ,[going
      near him],
      Helmer. Have you really the courage to open
      up that question again?
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. Yes, dear, you must do as I ask; you
      must let Krogstad keep his post in the bank.
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. My dear Nora, it is his post that I
      have arranged Mrs Linde shall have.
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. Yes, you have been awfully kind about
      that; but you could just as well dismiss some other clerk instead of
      Krogstad.
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. This is simply incredible
      obstinacy! Because you chose to give him a thoughtless promise that you
      would speak for him, I am expected to--
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. That isn't the reason, Torvald. It is
      for your own sake. This fellow writes in the most scurrilous newspapers;
      you have told me so yourself. He can do you an unspeakable amount of harm.
      I am frightened to death of him--
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. Ah, I understand; it is
      recollections of the past that scare you.
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. What do you mean?
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. Naturally you are thinking of your
      father.
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. Yes--yes, of course. Just recall to
      your mind what these malicious creatures wrote in the papers about papa,
      and how horribly they slandered him. I believe they would have procured
      his dismissal if the Department had not sent you over to inquire into it,
      and if you had not been so kindly disposed and helpful to him.
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. My little Nora, there is an
      important difference between your father and me. Your father's reputation
      as a public official was not above suspicion. Mine is, and I hope it will
      continue to be so, as long as I hold my office.
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. You never can tell what mischief
      these men may contrive. We ought to be so well off, so snug and happy here
      in our peaceful home, and have no cares--you and I and the children,
      Torvald! That is why I beg you so earnestly--
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. And it is just by interceding for
      him that you make it impossible for me to keep him. It is already known at
      the Bank that I mean to dismiss Krogstad. Is it to get about now that the
      new manager has changed his mind at his wife's bidding--
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. And what if it did?
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. Of course!--if only this obstinate
      little person can get her way! Do you suppose I am going to make myself
      ridiculous before my whole staff, to let people think that I am a man to
      be swayed by all sorts of outside influence? I should very soon feel the
      consequences of it, I can tell you! And besides, there is one thing that
      makes it quite impossible for me to have Krogstad in the Bank as long as I
      am manager.
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. Whatever is that?
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. His moral failings I might perhaps
      have overlooked, if necessary--
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. Yes, you could--couldn't you?
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. And I hear he is a good worker,
      too. But I knew him when we were boys. It was one of those rash
      friendships that so often prove an incubus in afterlife. I may as well
      tell you plainly, we were once on very intimate terms with one another.
      But this tactless fellow lays no restraint on himself when other people
      are present. On the contrary, he thinks it gives him the right to adopt a
      familiar tone with me, and every minute it is "I say, Helmer, old fellow!"
      and that sort of thing. I assure you it is extremely painful for me. He
      would make my position in the Bank intolerable.
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. Torvald, I don't believe you mean
      that.
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. Don't you? Why not?
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. Because it is such a narrow-minded
      way of looking at things.
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. What are you saying? Narrow-minded?
      Do you think I am narrow-minded?
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. No, just the opposite, dear--and it
      is exactly for that reason.
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. It's the same thing. You say my
      point of view is narrow-minded, so I must be so too. Narrow-minded! Very
      well--I must put an end to this. [Goes to
      the hall door and calls.] Helen!
    ,Helmer,[Goes to
      the hall door and calls.],
      Nora. What are you going to do?
    ,Nora,
      Helmer [looking
      among his papers]. Settle it. [Enter
      MAID.] Look here; take this letter and go downstairs with it at
      once. Find a messenger and tell him to deliver it, and be quick. The
      address is on it, and here is the money.
    ,Helmer ,[looking
      among his papers],[Enter
      MAID.],
      Maid. Very well, sir. [Exit with the letter.]
    ,Maid,[Exit with the letter.],
      Helmer [putting
      his papers together]. Now then, little Miss Obstinate.
    ,Helmer ,[putting
      his papers together],
      Nora [breathlessly].
      Torvald--what was that letter?
    ,Nora ,[breathlessly],
      Helmer. Krogstad's dismissal.
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. Call her back, Torvald! There is
      still time. Oh Torvald, call her back! Do it for my sake--for your own
      sake--for the children's sake! Do you hear me, Torvald? Call her back! You
      don't know what that letter can bring upon us.
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. It's too late.
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. Yes, it's too late.
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. My dear Nora, I can forgive the
      anxiety you are in, although really it is an insult to me. It is, indeed.
      Isn't it an insult to think that I should be afraid of a starving
      quill-driver's vengeance? But I forgive you nevertheless, because it is
      such eloquent witness to your great love for me. [Takes her in his arms.] And that is as it
      should be, my own darling Nora. Come what will, you may be sure I shall
      have both courage and strength if they be needed. You will see I am man
      enough to take everything upon myself.
    ,Helmer,[Takes her in his arms.],
      Nora [in a
      horror-stricken voice]. What do you mean by that?
    ,Nora ,[in a
      horror-stricken voice],
      Helmer. Everything, I say--
    ,Helmer,
      Nora [recovering
      herself]. You will never have to do that.
    ,Nora ,[recovering
      herself],
      Helmer. That's right. Well, we will share
      it, Nora, as man and wife should. That is how it shall be. [Caressing her.] Are you content now?
      There! There!--not these frightened dove's eyes! The whole thing is only
      the wildest fancy!--Now, you must go and play through the Tarantella and
      practise with your tambourine. I shall go into the inner office and shut
      the door, and I shall hear nothing; you can make as much noise as you
      please. [Turns back at the door.] And
      when Rank comes, tell him where he will find me. [Nods to her, takes his papers and goes into his
      room, and shuts the door after him.]
    ,Helmer,[Caressing her.],[Turns back at the door.],[Nods to her, takes his papers and goes into his
      room, and shuts the door after him.],
      Nora [bewildered
      with anxiety, stands as if rooted to the spot, and whispers]. He
      was capable of doing it. He will do it. He will do it in spite of
      everything.--No, not that! Never, never! Anything rather than that! Oh,
      for some help, some way out of it! [The
      door-bell rings.] Doctor Rank! Anything rather than that--anything,
      whatever it is! [She puts her hands over her
      face, pulls herself together, goes to the door and opens it. RANK is
      standing without, hanging up his coat. During the following dialogue it
      begins to grow dark.]
    ,Nora ,[bewildered
      with anxiety, stands as if rooted to the spot, and whispers],[The
      door-bell rings.],[She puts her hands over her
      face, pulls herself together, goes to the door and opens it. RANK is
      standing without, hanging up his coat. During the following dialogue it
      begins to grow dark.],
      Nora. Good day, Doctor Rank. I knew your
      ring. But you mustn't go in to Torvald now; I think he is busy with
      something.
    ,Nora,
      Rank. And you?
    ,Rank,
      Nora [brings
      him in and shuts the door after him]. Oh, you know very well I
      always have time for you.
    ,Nora ,[brings
      him in and shuts the door after him],
      Rank. Thank you. I shall make use of as
      much of it as I can.
    ,Rank,
      Nora. What do you mean by that? As much of
      it as you can?
    ,Nora,
      Rank. Well, does that alarm you?
    ,Rank,
      Nora. It was such a strange way of putting
      it. Is anything likely to happen?
    ,Nora,
      Rank. Nothing but what I have long been
      prepared for. But I certainly didn't expect it to happen so soon.
    ,Rank,
      Nora [gripping
      him by the arm]. What have you found out? Doctor Rank, you must
      tell me.
    ,Nora ,[gripping
      him by the arm],
      Rank [sitting
      down by the stove]. It is all up with me. And it can't be helped.
    ,Rank ,[sitting
      down by the stove],
      Nora [with a
      sigh of relief]. Is it about yourself?
    ,Nora ,[with a
      sigh of relief],
      Rank. Who else? It is no use lying to one's
      self. I am the most wretched of all my patients, Mrs Helmer. Lately I have
      been taking stock of my internal economy. Bankrupt! Probably within a
      month I shall lie rotting in the churchyard.
    ,Rank,
      Nora. What an ugly thing to say!
    ,Nora,
      Rank. The thing itself is cursedly ugly,
      and the worst of it is that I shall have to face so much more that is ugly
      before that. I shall only make one more examination of myself; when I have
      done that, I shall know pretty certainly when it will be that the horrors
      of dissolution will begin. There is something I want to tell you. Helmer's
      refined nature gives him an unconquerable disgust at everything that is
      ugly; I won't have him in my sick-room.
    ,Rank,
      Nora. Oh, but, Doctor Rank--
    ,Nora,
      Rank. I won't have him there. Not on any
      account. I bar my door to him. As soon as I am quite certain that the
      worst has come, I shall send you my card with a black cross on it, and
      then you will know that the loathsome end has begun.
    ,Rank,
      Nora. You are quite absurd today. And I
      wanted you so much to be in a really good humour.
    ,Nora,
      Rank. With death stalking beside me?--To
      have to pay this penalty for another man's sin? Is there any justice in
      that? And in every single family, in one way or another, some such
      inexorable retribution is being exacted--
    ,Rank,
      Nora [putting
      her hands over her ears]. Rubbish! Do talk of something cheerful.
    ,Nora ,[putting
      her hands over her ears],
      Rank. Oh, it's a mere laughing matter, the
      whole thing. My poor innocent spine has to suffer for my father's youthful
      amusements.
    ,Rank,
      Nora [sitting
      at the table on the left]. I suppose you mean that he was too
      partial to asparagus and pate de foie gras, don't you?
    ,Nora ,[sitting
      at the table on the left],
      Rank. Yes, and to truffles.
    ,Rank,
      Nora. Truffles, yes. And oysters too, I
      suppose?
    ,Nora,
      Rank. Oysters, of course, that goes without
      saying.
    ,Rank,
      Nora. And heaps of port and champagne. It
      is sad that all these nice things should take their revenge on our bones.
    ,Nora,
      Rank. Especially that they should revenge
      themselves on the unlucky bones of those who have not had the satisfaction
      of enjoying them.
    ,Rank,
      Nora. Yes, that's the saddest part of it
      all.
    ,Nora,
      Rank [with a
      searching look at her]. Hm!--
    ,Rank ,[with a
      searching look at her],
      Nora [after a
      short pause]. Why did you smile?
    ,Nora ,[after a
      short pause],
      Rank. No, it was you that laughed.
    ,Rank,
      Nora. No, it was you that smiled, Doctor
      Rank!
    ,Nora,
      Rank [rising].
      You are a greater rascal than I thought.
    ,Rank ,[rising],
      Nora. I am in a silly mood today.
    ,Nora,
      Rank. So it seems.
    ,Rank,
      Nora [putting
      her hands on his shoulders]. Dear, dear Doctor Rank, death mustn't
      take you away from Torvald and me.
    ,Nora ,[putting
      her hands on his shoulders],
      Rank. It is a loss you would easily recover
      from. Those who are gone are soon forgotten.
    ,Rank,
      Nora [looking
      at him anxiously]. Do you believe that?
    ,Nora ,[looking
      at him anxiously],
      Rank. People form new ties, and then--
    ,Rank,
      Nora. Who will form new ties?
    ,Nora,
      Rank. Both you and Helmer, when I am gone.
      You yourself are already on the high road to it, I think. What did that
      Mrs Linde want here last night?
    ,Rank,
      Nora. Oho!--you don't mean to say you are
      jealous of poor Christine?
    ,Nora,
      Rank. Yes, I am. She will be my successor
      in this house. When I am done for, this woman will--
    ,Rank,
      Nora. Hush! don't speak so loud. She is in
      that room.
    ,Nora,
      Rank. Today again. There, you see.
    ,Rank,
      Nora. She has only come to sew my dress for
      me. Bless my soul, how unreasonable you are! [Sits
      down on the sofa.] Be nice now, Doctor Rank, and tomorrow you will
      see how beautifully I shall dance, and you can imagine I am doing it all
      for you--and for Torvald too, of course. [Takes
      various things out of the box.] Doctor Rank, come and sit down
      here, and I will show you something.
    ,Nora,[Sits
      down on the sofa.],[Takes
      various things out of the box.],
      Rank [sitting
      down]. What is it?
    ,Rank ,[sitting
      down],
      Nora. Just look at those!
    ,Nora,
      Rank. Silk stockings.
    ,Rank,
      Nora. Flesh-coloured. Aren't they lovely?
      It is so dark here now, but tomorrow--. No, no, no! you must only look at
      the feet. Oh well, you may have leave to look at the legs too.
    ,Nora,
      Rank. Hm!--
    ,Rank,
      Nora. Why are you looking so critical?
      Don't you think they will fit me?
    ,Nora,
      Rank. I have no means of forming an opinion
      about that.
    ,Rank,
      Nora [looks
      at him for a moment]. For shame! [Hits
      him lightly on the ear with the stockings.] That's to punish you.
      [Folds them up again.]
    ,Nora ,[looks
      at him for a moment],[Hits
      him lightly on the ear with the stockings.],[Folds them up again.],
      Rank. And what other nice things am I to be
      allowed to see?
    ,Rank,
      Nora. Not a single thing more, for being so
      naughty. [She looks among the things,
      humming to herself.]
    ,Nora,[She looks among the things,
      humming to herself.],
      Rank [after a
      short silence]. When I am sitting here, talking to you as
      intimately as this, I cannot imagine for a moment what would have become
      of me if I had never come into this house.
    ,Rank ,[after a
      short silence],
      Nora [smiling].
      I believe you do feel thoroughly at home with us.
    ,Nora ,[smiling],
      Rank [in a
      lower voice, looking straight in front of him]. And to be obliged
      to leave it all--
    ,Rank ,[in a
      lower voice, looking straight in front of him],
      Nora. Nonsense, you are not going to leave
      it.
    ,Nora,
      Rank [as
      before]. And not be able to leave behind one the slightest token of
      one's gratitude, scarcely even a fleeting regret--nothing but an empty
      place which the first comer can fill as well as any other.
    ,Rank ,[as
      before],
      Nora. And if I asked you now for a--? No!
    ,Nora,
      Rank. For what?
    ,Rank,
      Nora. For a big proof of your friendship--
    ,Nora,
      Rank. Yes, yes!
    ,Rank,
      Nora. I mean a tremendously big favour--
    ,Nora,
      Rank. Would you really make me so happy for
      once?
    ,Rank,
      Nora. Ah, but you don't know what it is
      yet.
    ,Nora,
      Rank. No--but tell me.
    ,Rank,
      Nora. I really can't, Doctor Rank. It is
      something out of all reason; it means advice, and help, and a favour--
    ,Nora,
      Rank. The bigger a thing it is the better.
      I can't conceive what it is you mean. Do tell me. Haven't I your
      confidence?
    ,Rank,
      Nora. More than anyone else. I know you are
      my truest and best friend, and so I will tell you what it is. Well, Doctor
      Rank, it is something you must help me to prevent. You know how devotedly,
      how inexpressibly deeply Torvald loves me; he would never for a moment
      hesitate to give his life for me.
    ,Nora,
      Rank [leaning
      towards her]. Nora--do you think he is the only one--?
    ,Rank ,[leaning
      towards her],
      Nora [with a
      slight start]. The only one--?
    ,Nora ,[with a
      slight start],
      Rank. The only one who would gladly give
      his life for your sake.
    ,Rank,
      Nora [sadly].
      Is that it?
    ,Nora ,[sadly],
      Rank. I was determined you should know it
      before I went away, and there will never be a better opportunity than
      this. Now you know it, Nora. And now you know, too, that you can trust me
      as you would trust no one else.
    ,Rank,
      Nora [rises,
      deliberately and quietly]. Let me pass.
    ,Nora ,[rises,
      deliberately and quietly],
      Rank [makes
      room for her to pass him, but sits still]. Nora!
    ,Rank ,[makes
      room for her to pass him, but sits still],
      Nora [at the
      hall door]. Helen, bring in the lamp. [Goes
      over to the stove.] Dear Doctor Rank, that was really horrid of
      you.
    ,Nora ,[at the
      hall door],[Goes
      over to the stove.],
      Rank. To have loved you as much as anyone
      else does? Was that horrid?
    ,Rank,
      Nora. No, but to go and tell me so. There
      was really no need--
    ,Nora,
      Rank. What do you mean? Did you know--?
      [MAID enters with lamp, puts it down on the
      table, and goes out.] Nora--Mrs Helmer--tell me, had you any idea
      of this?
    ,Rank,[MAID enters with lamp, puts it down on the
      table, and goes out.],
      Nora. Oh, how do I know whether I had or
      whether I hadn't? I really can't tell you--To think you could be so
      clumsy, Doctor Rank! We were getting on so nicely.
    ,Nora,
      Rank. Well, at all events you know now that
      you can command me, body and soul. So won't you speak out?
    ,Rank,
      Nora [looking
      at him]. After what happened?
    ,Nora ,[looking
      at him],
      Rank. I beg you to let me know what it is.
    ,Rank,
      Nora. I can't tell you anything now.
    ,Nora,
      Rank. Yes, yes. You mustn't punish me in
      that way. Let me have permission to do for you whatever a man may do.
    ,Rank,
      Nora. You can do nothing for me now.
      Besides, I really don't need any help at all. You will find that the whole
      thing is merely fancy on my part. It really is so--of course it is! [Sits down in the rocking-chair, and looks at him
      with a smile.] You are a nice sort of man, Doctor Rank!--don't you
      feel ashamed of yourself, now the lamp has come?
    ,Nora,[Sits down in the rocking-chair, and looks at him
      with a smile.],
      Rank. Not a bit. But perhaps I had better
      go--for ever?
    ,Rank,
      Nora. No, indeed, you shall not. Of course
      you must come here just as before. You know very well Torvald can't do
      without you.
    ,Nora,
      Rank. Yes, but you?
    ,Rank,
      Nora. Oh, I am always tremendously pleased
      when you come.
    ,Nora,
      Rank. It is just that, that put me on the
      wrong track. You are a riddle to me. I have often thought that you would
      almost as soon be in my company as in Helmer's.
    ,Rank,
      Nora. Yes--you see there are some people
      one loves best, and others whom one would almost always rather have as
      companions.
    ,Nora,
      Rank. Yes, there is something in that.
    ,Rank,
      Nora. When I was at home, of course I loved
      papa best. But I always thought it tremendous fun if I could steal down
      into the maids' room, because they never moralised at all, and talked to
      each other about such entertaining things.
    ,Nora,
      Rank. I see--it is their place I have
      taken.
    ,Rank,
      Nora [jumping
      up and going to him]. Oh, dear, nice Doctor Rank, I never meant
      that at all. But surely you can understand that being with Torvald is a
      little like being with papa--[Enter MAID
      from the hall.]
    ,Nora ,[jumping
      up and going to him],[Enter MAID
      from the hall.],
      Maid. If you please, ma'am. [Whispers and hands her a card.]
    ,Maid,[Whispers and hands her a card.],
      Nora [glancing
      at the card]. Oh! [Puts it in her
      pocket.]
    ,Nora ,[glancing
      at the card],[Puts it in her
      pocket.],
      Rank. Is there anything wrong?
    ,Rank,
      Nora. No, no, not in the least. It is only
      something--it is my new dress--
    ,Nora,
      Rank. What? Your dress is lying there.
    ,Rank,
      Nora. Oh, yes, that one; but this is
      another. I ordered it. Torvald mustn't know about it--
    ,Nora,
      Rank. Oho! Then that was the great secret.
    ,Rank,
      Nora. Of course. Just go in to him; he is
      sitting in the inner room. Keep him as long as--
    ,Nora,
      Rank. Make your mind easy; I won't let him
      escape.
    ,Rank,
      [Goes into HELMER'S room.]
    ,[Goes into HELMER'S room.],
      Nora [to the
      MAID]. And he is standing waiting in the kitchen?
    ,Nora ,[to the
      MAID],
      Maid. Yes; he came up the back stairs.
    ,Maid,
      Nora. But didn't you tell him no one was
      in?
    ,Nora,
      Maid. Yes, but it was no good.
    ,Maid,
      Nora. He won't go away?
    ,Nora,
      Maid. No; he says he won't until he has
      seen you, ma'am.
    ,Maid,
      Nora. Well, let him come in--but quietly.
      Helen, you mustn't say anything about it to anyone. It is a surprise for
      my husband.
    ,Nora,
      Maid. Yes, ma'am, I quite understand. [Exit.]
    ,Maid,[Exit.],
      Nora. This dreadful thing is going to
      happen! It will happen in spite of me! No, no, no, it can't happen--it
      shan't happen! [She bolts the door of
      HELMER'S room. The MAID opens the hall door for KROGSTAD and shuts it
      after him. He is wearing a fur coat, high boots and a fur cap.]
    ,Nora,[She bolts the door of
      HELMER'S room. The MAID opens the hall door for KROGSTAD and shuts it
      after him. He is wearing a fur coat, high boots and a fur cap.],
      Nora [advancing
      towards him]. Speak low--my husband is at home.
    ,Nora ,[advancing
      towards him],
      Krogstad. No matter about that.
    ,Krogstad,
      Nora. What do you want of me?
    ,Nora,
      Krogstad. An explanation of something.
    ,Krogstad,
      Nora. Make haste then. What is it?
    ,Nora,
      Krogstad. You know, I suppose, that I have
      got my dismissal.
    ,Krogstad,
      Nora. I couldn't prevent it, Mr. Krogstad.
      I fought as hard as I could on your side, but it was no good.
    ,Nora,
      Krogstad. Does your husband love you so
      little, then? He knows what I can expose you to, and yet he ventures--
    ,Krogstad,
      Nora. How can you suppose that he has any
      knowledge of the sort?
    ,Nora,
      Krogstad. I didn't suppose so at all. It
      would not be the least like our dear Torvald Helmer to show so much
      courage--
    ,Krogstad,
      Nora. Mr. Krogstad, a little respect for my
      husband, please.
    ,Nora,
      Krogstad. Certainly--all the respect he
      deserves. But since you have kept the matter so carefully to yourself, I
      make bold to suppose that you have a little clearer idea, than you had
      yesterday, of what it actually is that you have done?
    ,Krogstad,
      Nora. More than you could ever teach me.
    ,Nora,
      Krogstad. Yes, such a bad lawyer as I am.
    ,Krogstad,
      Nora. What is it you want of me?
    ,Nora,
      Krogstad. Only to see how you were, Mrs
      Helmer. I have been thinking about you all day long. A mere cashier, a
      quill-driver, a--well, a man like me--even he has a little of what is
      called feeling, you know.
    ,Krogstad,
      Nora. Show it, then; think of my little
      children.
    ,Nora,
      Krogstad. Have you and your husband thought
      of mine? But never mind about that. I only wanted to tell you that you
      need not take this matter too seriously. In the first place there will be
      no accusation made on my part.
    ,Krogstad,
      Nora. No, of course not; I was sure of
      that.
    ,Nora,
      Krogstad. The whole thing can be arranged
      amicably; there is no reason why anyone should know anything about it. It
      will remain a secret between us three.
    ,Krogstad,
      Nora. My husband must never get to know
      anything about it.
    ,Nora,
      Krogstad. How will you be able to prevent
      it? Am I to understand that you can pay the balance that is owing?
    ,Krogstad,
      Nora. No, not just at present.
    ,Nora,
      Krogstad. Or perhaps that you have some
      expedient for raising the money soon?
    ,Krogstad,
      Nora. No expedient that I mean to make use
      of.
    ,Nora,
      Krogstad. Well, in any case, it would have
      been of no use to you now. If you stood there with ever so much money in
      your hand, I would never part with your bond.
    ,Krogstad,
      Nora. Tell me what purpose you mean to put
      it to.
    ,Nora,
      Krogstad. I shall only preserve it--keep it
      in my possession. No one who is not concerned in the matter shall have the
      slightest hint of it. So that if the thought of it has driven you to any
      desperate resolution--
    ,Krogstad,
      Nora. It has.
    ,Nora,
      Krogstad. If you had it in your mind to run
      away from your home--
    ,Krogstad,
      Nora. I had.
    ,Nora,
      Krogstad. Or even something worse--
    ,Krogstad,
      Nora. How could you know that?
    ,Nora,
      Krogstad. Give up the idea.
    ,Krogstad,
      Nora. How did you know I had thought of
      that?
    ,Nora,
      Krogstad. Most of us think of that at
      first. I did, too--but I hadn't the courage.
    ,Krogstad,
      Nora [faintly].
      No more had I.
    ,Nora ,[faintly],
      Krogstad [in
      a tone of relief]. No, that's it, isn't it--you hadn't the courage
      either?
    ,Krogstad ,[in
      a tone of relief],
      Nora. No, I haven't--I haven't.
    ,Nora,
      Krogstad. Besides, it would have been a
      great piece of folly. Once the first storm at home is over--. I have a
      letter for your husband in my pocket.
    ,Krogstad,
      Nora. Telling him everything?
    ,Nora,
      Krogstad. In as lenient a manner as I
      possibly could.
    ,Krogstad,
      Nora [quickly].
      He mustn't get the letter. Tear it up. I will find some means of getting
      money.
    ,Nora ,[quickly],
      Krogstad. Excuse me, Mrs Helmer, but I
      think I told you just now--
    ,Krogstad,
      Nora. I am not speaking of what I owe you.
      Tell me what sum you are asking my husband for, and I will get the money.
    ,Nora,
      Krogstad. I am not asking your husband for
      a penny.
    ,Krogstad,
      Nora. What do you want, then?
    ,Nora,
      Krogstad. I will tell you. I want to
      rehabilitate myself, Mrs Helmer; I want to get on; and in that your
      husband must help me. For the last year and a half I have not had a hand
      in anything dishonourable, amid all that time I have been struggling in
      most restricted circumstances. I was content to work my way up step by
      step. Now I am turned out, and I am not going to be satisfied with merely
      being taken into favour again. I want to get on, I tell you. I want to get
      into the Bank again, in a higher position. Your husband must make a place
      for me--
    ,Krogstad,
      Nora. That he will never do!
    ,Nora,
      Krogstad. He will; I know him; he dare not
      protest. And as soon as I am in there again with him, then you will see!
      Within a year I shall be the manager's right hand. It will be Nils
      Krogstad and not Torvald Helmer who manages the Bank.
    ,Krogstad,
      Nora. That's a thing you will never see!
    ,Nora,
      Krogstad. Do you mean that you will--?
    ,Krogstad,
      Nora. I have courage enough for it now.
    ,Nora,
      Krogstad. Oh, you can't frighten me. A
      fine, spoilt lady like you--
    ,Krogstad,
      Nora. You will see, you will see.
    ,Nora,
      Krogstad. Under the ice, perhaps? Down into
      the cold, coal-black water? And then, in the spring, to float up to the surface,
      all horrible and unrecognisable, with your hair fallen out--
    ,Krogstad,
      Nora. You can't frighten me.
    ,Nora,
      Krogstad. Nor you me. People don't do such
      things, Mrs Helmer. Besides, what use would it be? I should have him
      completely in my power all the same.
    ,Krogstad,
      Nora. Afterwards? When I am no longer--
    ,Nora,
      Krogstad. Have you forgotten that it is I
      who have the keeping of your reputation? [NORA
      stands speechlessly looking at him.] Well, now, I have warned you.
      Do not do anything foolish. When Helmer has had my letter, I shall expect
      a message from him. And be sure you remember that it is your husband
      himself who has forced me into such ways as this again. I will never
      forgive him for that. Goodbye, Mrs Helmer. [Exit
      through the hall.]
    ,Krogstad,[NORA
      stands speechlessly looking at him.],[Exit
      through the hall.],
      Nora [goes to
      the hall door, opens it slightly and listens.] He is going. He is
      not putting the letter in the box. Oh no, no! that's impossible! [Opens the door by degrees.] What is that?
      He is standing outside. He is not going downstairs. Is he hesitating? Can
      he--? [A letter drops into the box; then
      KROGSTAD'S footsteps are heard, until they die away as he goes downstairs.
      NORA utters a stifled cry, and runs across the room to the table by the
      sofa. A short pause.]

      the hall door, opens it slightly and listens.],[Opens the door by degrees.],[A letter drops into the box; then

      Nora. In the letter-box. [Steals across to the hall door.] There it
      lies--Torvald, Torvald, there is no hope for us now!
    ,Nora,[Steals across to the hall door.],
      [Mrs Linde comes in from the room on the
      left, carrying the dress.]
    ,[Mrs Linde comes in from the room on the
      left, carrying the dress.],
      Mrs Linde. There, I can't see anything more
      to mend now. Would you like to try it on--?
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Nora [in a
      hoarse whisper]. Christine, come here.
    ,Nora ,[in a
      hoarse whisper],
      Mrs Linde [throwing
      the dress down on the sofa]. What is the matter with you? You look
      so agitated!
    ,Mrs Linde,[throwing
      the dress down on the sofa],
      Nora. Come here. Do you see that letter?
      There, look--you can see it through the glass in the letter-box.
    ,Nora,
      Mrs Linde. Yes, I see it.
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Nora. That letter is from Krogstad.
    ,Nora,
      Mrs Linde. Nora--it was Krogstad who lent
      you the money!
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Nora. Yes, and now Torvald will know all
      about it.
    ,Nora,
      Mrs Linde. Believe me, Nora, that's the
      best thing for both of you.
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Nora. You don't know all. I forged a name.
    ,Nora,
      Mrs Linde. Good heavens--!
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Nora. I only want to say this to you,
      Christine--you must be my witness.
    ,Nora,
      Mrs Linde. Your witness? What do you mean?
      What am I to--?
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Nora. If I should go out of my mind--and it
      might easily happen--
    ,Nora,
      Mrs Linde. Nora!
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Nora. Or if anything else should happen to
      me--anything, for instance, that might prevent my being here--
    ,Nora,
      Mrs Linde. Nora! Nora! you are quite out of
      your mind.
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Nora. And if it should happen that there
      were some one who wanted to take all the responsibility, all the blame,
      you understand--
    ,Nora,
      Mrs Linde. Yes, yes--but how can you
      suppose--?
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Nora. Then you must be my witness, that it
      is not true, Christine. I am not out of my mind at all; I am in my right
      senses now, and I tell you no one else has known anything about it; I, and
      I alone, did the whole thing. Remember that.
    ,Nora,
      Mrs Linde. I will, indeed. But I don't
      understand all this.
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Nora. How should you understand it? A
      wonderful thing is going to happen!
    ,Nora,
      Mrs Linde. A wonderful thing?
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Nora. Yes, a wonderful thing!--But it is so
      terrible, Christine; it mustn't happen, not for all the world.
    ,Nora,
      Mrs Linde. I will go at once and see
      Krogstad.
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Nora. Don't go to him; he will do you some
      harm.
    ,Nora,
      Mrs Linde. There was a time when he would
      gladly do anything for my sake.
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Nora. He?
    ,Nora,
      Mrs Linde. Where does he live?
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Nora. How should I know--? Yes [feeling in her pocket], here is his card.
      But the letter, the letter--!
    ,Nora,[feeling in her pocket],
      Helmer [calls
      from his room, knocking at the door]. Nora! Nora [cries out anxiously]. Oh, what's that?
      What do you want?
    ,Helmer ,[calls
      from his room, knocking at the door],[cries out anxiously],
      Helmer. Don't be so frightened. We are not
      coming in; you have locked the door. Are you trying on your dress?
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. Yes, that's it. I look so nice,
      Torvald.
    ,Nora,
      Mrs Linde [who
      has read the card]. I see he lives at the corner here.
    ,Mrs Linde,[who
      has read the card],
      Nora. Yes, but it's no use. It is hopeless.
      The letter is lying there in the box.
    ,Nora,
      Mrs Linde. And your husband keeps the key?
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Nora. Yes, always.
    ,Nora,
      Mrs Linde. Krogstad must ask for his letter
      back unread, he must find some pretence--
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Nora. But it is just at this time that
      Torvald generally--
    ,Nora,
      Mrs Linde. You must delay him. Go in to him
      in the meantime. I will come back as soon as I can. [She goes out hurriedly through the hall door.]
    ,Mrs Linde,[She goes out hurriedly through the hall door.],
      Nora [goes to
      HELMER'S door, opens it and peeps in]. Torvald!
    ,Nora ,[goes to
      HELMER'S door, opens it and peeps in],
      Helmer [from
      the inner room]. Well? May I venture at last to come into my own
      room again? Come along, Rank, now you will see-- [Halting in the doorway.] But what is this?
    ,Helmer ,[from
      the inner room],[Halting in the doorway.],
      Nora. What is what, dear?
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. Rank led me to expect a splendid
      transformation.
    ,Helmer,
      Rank [in the
      doorway]. I understood so, but evidently I was mistaken.
    ,Rank ,[in the
      doorway],
      Nora. Yes, nobody is to have the chance of
      admiring me in my dress until tomorrow.
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. But, my dear Nora, you look so worn
      out. Have you been practising too much?
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. No, I have not practised at all.
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. But you will need to--
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. Yes, indeed I shall, Torvald. But I
      can't get on a bit without you to help me; I have absolutely forgotten the
      whole thing.
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. Oh, we will soon work it up again.
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. Yes, help me, Torvald. Promise that
      you will! I am so nervous about it--all the people--. You must give
      yourself up to me entirely this evening. Not the tiniest bit of
      business--you mustn't even take a pen in your hand. Will you promise,
      Torvald dear?
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. I promise. This evening I will be
      wholly and absolutely at your service, you helpless little mortal. Ah, by
      the way, first of all I will just-- [Goes
      towards the hall door.]
    ,Helmer,[Goes
      towards the hall door.],
      Nora. What are you going to do there?
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. Only see if any letters have come.
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. No, no! don't do that, Torvald!
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. Why not?
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. Torvald, please don't. There is
      nothing there.
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. Well, let me look. [Turns to go to the letter-box. NORA, at the
      piano, plays the first bars of the Tarantella. HELMER stops in the
      doorway.] Aha!
    ,Helmer,[Turns to go to the letter-box. NORA, at the
      piano, plays the first bars of the Tarantella. HELMER stops in the
      doorway.],
      Nora. I can't dance tomorrow if I don't
      practise with you.
    ,Nora,
      Helmer [going
      up to her]. Are you really so afraid of it, dear?
    ,Helmer ,[going
      up to her],
      Nora. Yes, so dreadfully afraid of it. Let
      me practise at once; there is time now, before we go to dinner. Sit down
      and play for me, Torvald dear; criticise me, and correct me as you play.
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. With great pleasure, if you wish me
      to. [Sits down at the piano.]
    ,Helmer,[Sits down at the piano.],
      Nora [takes
      out of the box a tambourine and a long variegated shawl. She hastily
      drapes the shawl round her. Then she springs to the front of the stage and
      calls out]. Now play for me! I am going to dance!
    ,Nora ,[takes
      out of the box a tambourine and a long variegated shawl. She hastily
      drapes the shawl round her. Then she springs to the front of the stage and

      Helmer [as he
      plays]. Slower, slower!
    ,Helmer ,[as he
      plays],
      Nora. I can't do it any other way.
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. Not so violently, Nora!
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. This is the way.
    ,Nora,
      Helmer [stops
      playing]. No, no--that is not a bit right.
    ,Helmer ,[stops
      playing],
      Nora [laughing
      and swinging the tambourine]. Didn't I tell you so?
    ,Nora ,[laughing
      and swinging the tambourine],
      Rank. Let me play for her.
    ,Rank,
      Helmer [getting
      up]. Yes, do. I can correct her better then.

      up],

    ,Helmer,
      Nora. Yes, you see how much I need it. You
      must coach me up to the last minute. Promise me that, Torvald!
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. You can depend on me.
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. You must not think of anything but
      me, either today or tomorrow; you mustn't open a single letter--not even
      open the letter-box--
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. Ah, you are still afraid of that
      fellow--
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. Yes, indeed I am.
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. Nora, I can tell from your looks
      that there is a letter from him lying there.
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. I don't know; I think there is; but
      you must not read anything of that kind now. Nothing horrid must come
      between us until this is all over.

      to HELMER]. You mustn't contradict her.
    ,Rank ,[whispers

      after you have danced--

    ,Maid,

      banquet?
    ,Helmer,

      small hours. [Calls out.] And a few
      macaroons, Helen--lots, just for once!
    ,Nora,[Calls out.],
      Helmer. Come, come, don't be so wild and
      nervous. Be my own little skylark, as you used.
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. Yes, dear, I will. But go in now and
      you too, Doctor Rank. Christine, you must help me to do up my hair.
    ,Nora,
      Rank [whispers
      to HELMER as they go out]. I suppose there is nothing--she is not
      expecting anything?
    ,Rank ,[whispers
      to HELMER as they go out],
      Helmer. Far from it, my dear fellow; it is
      simply nothing more than this childish nervousness I was telling you of.

    ,Nora,
      Mrs Linde. Gone out of town.
    ,Mrs Linde,

    ,Nora,
      Mrs Linde. He is coming home tomorrow
      evening. I wrote a note for him.
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Nora. You should have let it alone; you
      must prevent nothing. After all, it is splendid to be waiting for a
      wonderful thing to happen.
    ,Nora,
      Mrs Linde. What is it that you are waiting
      for?
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Nora. Oh, you wouldn't understand. Go in to
      them, I will come in a moment. [Mrs Linde

      hours until midnight; and then four-and-twenty hours until the next
      midnight. Then the Tarantella will be over. Twenty-four and seven?
      Thirty-one hours to live.

      ACT III
    ,
      [THE SAME SCENE.--The table has been placed
      in the middle of the stage, with chairs around it. A lamp is burning on
      the table. The door into the hall stands open. Dance music is heard in the
      room above. Mrs Linde is sitting at the table idly turning over the leaves
      of a book; she tries to read, but does not seem able to collect her
      thoughts. Every now and then she listens intently for a sound at the outer

      Mrs Linde [looking

      not--. [Listens again.] Ah, there he
      is. [Goes into the hall and opens the outer
      door carefully. Light footsteps are heard on the stairs. She whispers.]
      Come in. There is no one here.
    ,Mrs Linde,[looking
      at her watch],[Listens again.],[Goes into the hall and opens the outer
      door carefully. Light footsteps are heard on the stairs. She whispers.],
      Krogstad [in
      the doorway]. I found a note from you at home. What does this mean?
    ,Krogstad ,[in
      the doorway],
      Mrs Linde. It is absolutely necessary that
      I should have a talk with you.
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Krogstad. Really? And is it absolutely
      necessary that it should be here?
    ,Krogstad,
      Mrs Linde. It is impossible where I live;
      there is no private entrance to my rooms. Come in; we are quite alone. The
      maid is asleep, and the Helmers are at the dance upstairs.
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Krogstad [coming
      into the room]. Are the Helmers really at a dance tonight?
    ,Krogstad ,[coming
      into the room],
      Mrs Linde. Yes, why not?
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Krogstad. Certainly--why not?
    ,Krogstad,
      Mrs Linde. Now, Nils, let us have a talk.
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Krogstad. Can we two have anything to talk
      about?
    ,Krogstad,
      Mrs Linde. We have a great deal to talk
      about.
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Krogstad. I shouldn't have thought so.
    ,Krogstad,
      Mrs Linde. No, you have never properly
      understood me.
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Krogstad. Was there anything else to
      understand except what was obvious to all the world--a heartless woman
      jilts a man when a more lucrative chance turns up?
    ,Krogstad,
      Mrs Linde. Do you believe I am as
      absolutely heartless as all that? And do you believe that I did it with a
      light heart?
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Krogstad. Didn't you?
    ,Krogstad,
      Mrs Linde. Nils, did you really think that?
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Krogstad. If it were as you say, why did
      you write to me as you did at the time?
    ,Krogstad,
      Mrs Linde. I could do nothing else. As I
      had to break with you, it was my duty also to put an end to all that you
      felt for me.
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Krogstad [wringing
      his hands]. So that was it. And all this--only for the sake of
      money!
    ,Krogstad ,[wringing
      his hands],
      Mrs Linde. You must not forget that I had a
      helpless mother and two little brothers. We couldn't wait for you, Nils;
      your prospects seemed hopeless then.
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Krogstad. That may be so, but you had no
      right to throw me over for anyone else's sake.
    ,Krogstad,
      Mrs Linde. Indeed I don't know. Many a time
      did I ask myself if I had the right to do it.
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Krogstad [more
      gently]. When I lost you, it was as if all the solid ground went
      from under my feet. Look at me now--I am a shipwrecked man clinging to a
      bit of wreckage.
    ,Krogstad ,[more
      gently],
      Mrs Linde. But help may be near.
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Krogstad. It was near; but then you came
      and stood in my way.
    ,Krogstad,
      Mrs Linde. Unintentionally, Nils. It was
      only today that I learned it was your place I was going to take in the
      Bank.
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Krogstad. I believe you, if you say so. But
      now that you know it, are you not going to give it up to me?
    ,Krogstad,
      Mrs Linde. No, because that would not
      benefit you in the least.
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Krogstad. Oh, benefit, benefit--I would
      have done it whether or no.
    ,Krogstad,
      Mrs Linde. I have learned to act prudently.
      Life, and hard, bitter necessity have taught me that.
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Krogstad. And life has taught me not to
      believe in fine speeches.
    ,Krogstad,
      Mrs Linde. Then life has taught you
      something very reasonable. But deeds you must believe in?
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Krogstad. What do you mean by that?
    ,Krogstad,
      Mrs Linde. You said you were like a
      shipwrecked man clinging to some wreckage.
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Krogstad. I had good reason to say so.
    ,Krogstad,
      Mrs Linde. Well, I am like a shipwrecked
      woman clinging to some wreckage--no one to mourn for, no one to care for.
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Krogstad. It was your own choice.
    ,Krogstad,
      Mrs Linde. There was no other choice--then.
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Krogstad. Well, what now?
    ,Krogstad,
      Mrs Linde. Nils, how would it be if we two
      shipwrecked people could join forces?
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Krogstad. What are you saying?
    ,Krogstad,
      Mrs Linde. Two on the same piece of
      wreckage would stand a better chance than each on their own.
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Krogstad. Christine I...
    ,Krogstad,
      Mrs Linde. What do you suppose brought me
      to town?
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Krogstad. Do you mean that you gave me a
      thought?
    ,Krogstad,
      Mrs Linde. I could not endure life without
      work. All my life, as long as I can remember, I have worked, and it has
      been my greatest and only pleasure. But now I am quite alone in the
      world--my life is so dreadfully empty and I feel so forsaken. There is not
      the least pleasure in working for one's self. Nils, give me someone and
      something to work for.
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Krogstad. I don't trust that. It is nothing
      but a woman's overstrained sense of generosity that prompts you to make
      such an offer of yourself.
    ,Krogstad,
      Mrs Linde. Have you ever noticed anything
      of the sort in me?
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Krogstad. Could you really do it? Tell
      me--do you know all about my past life?
    ,Krogstad,
      Mrs Linde. Yes.
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Krogstad. And do you know what they think
      of me here?
    ,Krogstad,
      Mrs Linde. You seemed to me to imply that
      with me you might have been quite another man.
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Krogstad. I am certain of it.
    ,Krogstad,
      Mrs Linde. Is it too late now?
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Krogstad. Christine, are you saying this
      deliberately? Yes, I am sure you are. I see it in your face. Have you
      really the courage, then--?
    ,Krogstad,
      Mrs Linde. I want to be a mother to
      someone, and your children need a mother. We two need each other. Nils, I
      have faith in your real character--I can dare anything together with you.
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Krogstad [grasps
      her hands]. Thanks, thanks, Christine! Now I shall find a way to
      clear myself in the eyes of the world. Ah, but I forgot--
    ,Krogstad ,[grasps
      her hands],
      Mrs Linde [listening].
      Hush! The Tarantella! Go, go!
    ,Mrs Linde,[listening],
      Krogstad. Why? What is it?
    ,Krogstad,
      Mrs Linde. Do you hear them up there? When
      that is over, we may expect them back.
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Krogstad. Yes, yes--I will go. But it is
      all no use. Of course you are not aware what steps I have taken in the
      matter of the Helmers.
    ,Krogstad,
      Mrs Linde. Yes, I know all about that.
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Krogstad. And in spite of that have you the
      courage to--?
    ,Krogstad,
      Mrs Linde. I understand very well to what
      lengths a man like you might be driven by despair.
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Krogstad. If I could only undo what I have
      done!
    ,Krogstad,
      Mrs Linde. You cannot. Your letter is lying
      in the letter-box now.
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Krogstad. Are you sure of that?
    ,Krogstad,
      Mrs Linde. Quite sure, but--
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Krogstad [with
      a searching look at her]. Is that what it all means?--that you want
      to save your friend at any cost? Tell me frankly. Is that it?
    ,Krogstad ,[with
      a searching look at her],
      Mrs Linde. Nils, a woman who has once sold
      herself for another's sake, doesn't do it a second time.
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Krogstad. I will ask for my letter back.
    ,Krogstad,
      Mrs Linde. No, no.
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Krogstad. Yes, of course I will. I will
      wait here until Helmer comes; I will tell him he must give me my letter
      back--that it only concerns my dismissal--that he is not to read it--
    ,Krogstad,
      Mrs Linde. No, Nils, you must not recall
      your letter.
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Krogstad. But, tell me, wasn't it for that
      very purpose that you asked me to meet you here?
    ,Krogstad,
      Mrs Linde. In my first moment of fright, it
      was. But twenty-four hours have elapsed since then, and in that time I
      have witnessed incredible things in this house. Helmer must know all about
      it. This unhappy secret must be disclosed; they must have a complete
      understanding between them, which is impossible with all this concealment
      and falsehood going on.
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Krogstad. Very well, if you will take the
      responsibility. But there is one thing I can do in any case, and I shall
      do it at once.
    ,Krogstad,
      Mrs Linde [listening].
      You must be quick and go! The dance is over; we are not safe a moment
      longer.
    ,Mrs Linde,[listening],
      Krogstad. I will wait for you below.
    ,Krogstad,
      Mrs Linde. Yes, do. You must see me back to
      my door...
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Krogstad. I have never had such an amazing
      piece of good fortune in my life! [Goes out
      through the outer door. The door between the room and the hall remains
      open.]
    ,Krogstad,[Goes out
      through the outer door. The door between the room and the hall remains
      open.],
      Mrs Linde [tidying
      up the room and laying her hat and cloak ready]. What a difference!
      what a difference! Someone to work for and live for--a home to bring
      comfort into. That I will do, indeed. I wish they would be quick and
      come--[Listens.] Ah, there they are
      now. I must put on my things. [Takes up her
      hat and cloak. HELMER'S and NORA'S voices are heard outside; a key is
      turned, and HELMER brings NORA almost by force into the hall. She is in an
      Italian costume with a large black shawl around her; he is in evening
      dress, and a black domino which is flying open.]

      Nora [hanging
      back in the doorway, and struggling with him]. No, no, no!--don't
      take me in. I want to go upstairs again; I don't want to leave so early.
    ,Nora ,[hanging
      back in the doorway, and struggling with him],
      Helmer. But, my dearest Nora--
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. Please, Torvald dear--please,
      please--only an hour more.
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. Not a single minute, my sweet Nora.
      You know that was our agreement. Come along into the room; you are
      catching cold standing there. [He brings her
      gently into the room, in spite of her resistance.]
    ,Helmer,[He brings her
      gently into the room, in spite of her resistance.],
      Mrs Linde. Good evening.
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Nora. Christine!
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. You here, so late, Mrs Linde?
    ,Helmer,
      Mrs Linde. Yes, you must excuse me; I was
      so anxious to see Nora in her dress.
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Nora. Have you been sitting here waiting
      for me?
    ,Nora,
      Mrs Linde. Yes, unfortunately I came too
      late, you had already gone upstairs; and I thought I couldn't go away
      again without having seen you.
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Helmer [taking
      off NORA'S shawl]. Yes, take a good look at her. I think she is
      worth looking at. Isn't she charming, Mrs Linde?
    ,Helmer ,[taking
      off NORA'S shawl],
      Mrs Linde. Yes, indeed she is.
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Helmer. Doesn't she look remarkably pretty?
      Everyone thought so at the dance. But she is terribly self-willed, this
      sweet little person. What are we to do with her? You will hardly believe
      that I had almost to bring her away by force.
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. Torvald, you will repent not having
      let me stay, even if it were only for half an hour.
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. Listen to her, Mrs Linde! She had
      danced her Tarantella, and it had been a tremendous success, as it
      deserved--although possibly the performance was a trifle too realistic--a
      little more so, I mean, than was strictly compatible with the limitations
      of art. But never mind about that! The chief thing is, she had made a
      success--she had made a tremendous success. Do you think I was going to
      let her remain there after that, and spoil the effect? No, indeed! I took
      my charming little Capri maiden--my capricious little Capri maiden, I
      should say--on my arm; took one quick turn round the room; a curtsey on
      either side, and, as they say in novels, the beautiful apparition
      disappeared. An exit ought always to be effective, Mrs Linde; but that is
      what I cannot make Nora understand. Pooh! this room is hot. [Throws his domino on a chair, and opens the door
      of his room.] Hullo! it's all dark in here. Oh, of course--excuse
      me--. [He goes in, and lights some candles.]
    ,Helmer,[Throws his domino on a chair, and opens the door
      of his room.],[He goes in, and lights some candles.],
      Nora [in a
      hurried and breathless whisper]. Well?
    ,Nora ,[in a
      hurried and breathless whisper],
      Mrs Linde [in
      a low voice]. I have had a talk with him.
    ,Mrs Linde,[in
      a low voice],
      Nora. Yes, and--
    ,Nora,
      Mrs Linde. Nora, you must tell your husband
      all about it.
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Nora [in an
      expressionless voice]. I knew it.
    ,Nora ,[in an
      expressionless voice],
      Mrs Linde. You have nothing to be afraid of
      as far as Krogstad is concerned; but you must tell him.
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Nora. I won't tell him.
    ,Nora,
      Mrs Linde. Then the letter will.
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Nora. Thank you, Christine. Now I know what
      I must do. Hush--!
    ,Nora,
      Helmer [coming
      in again]. Well, Mrs Linde, have you admired her?
    ,Helmer ,[coming
      in again],
      Mrs Linde. Yes, and now I will say
      goodnight.
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Helmer. What, already? Is this yours, this
      knitting?
    ,Helmer,
      Mrs Linde [taking
      it]. Yes, thank you, I had very nearly forgotten it.
    ,Mrs Linde,[taking
      it],
      Helmer. So you knit?
    ,Helmer,
      Mrs Linde. Of course.
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Helmer. Do you know, you ought to
      embroider.
    ,Helmer,
      Mrs Linde. Really? Why?
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Helmer. Yes, it's far more becoming. Let me
      show you. You hold the embroidery thus in your left hand, and use the
      needle with the right--like this--with a long, easy sweep. Do you see?
    ,Helmer,
      Mrs Linde. Yes, perhaps--
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Helmer. But in the case of knitting--that
      can never be anything but ungraceful; look here--the arms close together,
      the knitting-needles going up and down--it has a sort of Chinese effect--.
      That was really excellent champagne they gave us.
    ,Helmer,
      Mrs Linde. Well,--goodnight, Nora, and
      don't be self-willed any more.
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Helmer. That's right, Mrs Linde.
    ,Helmer,
      Mrs Linde. Goodnight, Mr. Helmer.
    ,Mrs Linde,
      Helmer [accompanying
      her to the door]. Goodnight, goodnight. I hope you will get home
      all right. I should be very happy to--but you haven't any great distance
      to go. Goodnight, goodnight. [She goes out;
      he shuts the door after her, and comes in again.] Ah!--at last we
      have got rid of her. She is a frightful bore, that woman.
    ,Helmer ,[accompanying
      her to the door],[She goes out;
      he shuts the door after her, and comes in again.],
      Nora. Aren't you very tired, Torvald?
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. No, not in the least.
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. Nor sleepy?
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. Not a bit. On the contrary, I feel
      extraordinarily lively. And you?--you really look both tired and sleepy.
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. Yes, I am very tired. I want to go to
      sleep at once.
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. There, you see it was quite right
      of me not to let you stay there any longer.
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. Everything you do is quite right,
      Torvald.
    ,Nora,
      Helmer [kissing
      her on the forehead]. Now my little skylark is speaking reasonably.
      Did you notice what good spirits Rank was in this evening?
    ,Helmer ,[kissing
      her on the forehead],
      Nora. Really? Was he? I didn't speak to him
      at all.
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. And I very little, but I have not
      for a long time seen him in such good form. [Looks
      for a while at her and then goes nearer to her.] It is delightful
      to be at home by ourselves again, to be all alone with you--you
      fascinating, charming little darling!
    ,Helmer,[Looks
      for a while at her and then goes nearer to her.],
      Nora. Don't look at me like that, Torvald.
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. Why shouldn't I look at my dearest
      treasure?--at all the beauty that is mine, all my very own?
    ,Helmer,
      Nora [going
      to the other side of the table]. You mustn't say things like that
      to me tonight.
    ,Nora ,[going
      to the other side of the table],
      Helmer [following
      her]. You have still got the Tarantella in your blood, I see. And
      it makes you more captivating than ever. Listen--the guests are beginning
      to go now. [In a lower voice.]
      Nora--soon the whole house will be quiet.
    ,Helmer ,[following
      her],[In a lower voice.],
      Nora. Yes, I hope so.
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. Yes, my own darling Nora. Do you
      know, when I am out at a party with you like this, why I speak so little
      to you, keep away from you, and only send a stolen glance in your
      direction now and then?--do you know why I do that? It is because I make
      believe to myself that we are secretly in love, and you are my secretly
      promised bride, and that no one suspects there is anything between us.
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. Yes, yes--I know very well your
      thoughts are with me all the time.
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. And when we are leaving, and I am
      putting the shawl over your beautiful young shoulders--on your lovely
      neck--then I imagine that you are my young bride and that we have just
      come from the wedding, and I am bringing you for the first time into our
      home--to be alone with you for the first time--quite alone with my shy
      little darling! All this evening I have longed for nothing but you. When I
      watched the seductive figures of the Tarantella, my blood was on fire; I
      could endure it no longer, and that was why I brought you down so early--
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. Go away, Torvald! You must let me go.
      I won't--
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. What's that? You're joking, my
      little Nora! You won't--you won't? Am I not your husband--? [A knock is heard at the outer door.]
    ,Helmer,[A knock is heard at the outer door.],
      Nora [starting].
      Did you hear--?
    ,Nora ,[starting],
      Helmer [going
      into the hall]. Who is it?
    ,Helmer ,[going
      into the hall],
      Rank [outside].
      It is I. May I come in for a moment?
    ,Rank ,[outside],
      Helmer [in a
      fretful whisper]. Oh, what does he want now? [Aloud.] Wait a minute! [Unlocks the door.] Come, that's kind of
      you not to pass by our door.
    ,Helmer ,[in a
      fretful whisper],[Aloud.],[Unlocks the door.],
      Rank. I thought I heard your voice, and
      felt as if I should like to look in. [With a
      swift glance round.] Ah, yes!--these dear familiar rooms. You are
      very happy and cosy in here, you two.
    ,Rank,[With a
      swift glance round.],
      Helmer. It seems to me that you looked
      after yourself pretty well upstairs too.
    ,Helmer,
      Rank. Excellently. Why shouldn't I? Why
      shouldn't one enjoy everything in this world?--at any rate as much as one
      can, and as long as one can. The wine was capital--
    ,Rank,
      Helmer. Especially the champagne.
    ,Helmer,
      Rank. So you noticed that too? It is almost
      incredible how much I managed to put away!
    ,Rank,
      Nora. Torvald drank a great deal of
      champagne tonight too.
    ,Nora,
      Rank. Did he?
    ,Rank,
      Nora. Yes, and he is always in such good
      spirits afterwards.
    ,Nora,
      Rank. Well, why should one not enjoy a
      merry evening after a well-spent day?
    ,Rank,
      Helmer. Well spent? I am afraid I can't
      take credit for that.
    ,Helmer,
      Rank [clapping
      him on the back]. But I can, you know!
    ,Rank ,[clapping
      him on the back],
      Nora. Doctor Rank, you must have been
      occupied with some scientific investigation today.
    ,Nora,
      Rank. Exactly.
    ,Rank,
      Helmer. Just listen!--little Nora talking
      about scientific investigations!
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. And may I congratulate you on the
      result?
    ,Nora,
      Rank. Indeed you may.
    ,Rank,
      Nora. Was it favourable, then?
    ,Nora,
      Rank. The best possible, for both doctor
      and patient--certainty.
    ,Rank,
      Nora [quickly
      and searchingly]. Certainty?
    ,Nora ,[quickly
      and searchingly],
      Rank. Absolute certainty. So wasn't I
      entitled to make a merry evening of it after that?
    ,Rank,
      Nora. Yes, you certainly were, Doctor Rank.
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. I think so too, so long as you
      don't have to pay for it in the morning.
    ,Helmer,
      Rank. Oh well, one can't have anything in
      this life without paying for it.
    ,Rank,
      Nora. Doctor Rank--are you fond of
      fancy-dress balls?
    ,Nora,
      Rank. Yes, if there is a fine lot of pretty
      costumes.
    ,Rank,
      Nora. Tell me--what shall we two wear at
      the next?
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. Little featherbrain!--are you
      thinking of the next already?
    ,Helmer,
      Rank. We two? Yes, I can tell you. You
      shall go as a good fairy--
    ,Rank,
      Helmer. Yes, but what do you suggest as an
      appropriate costume for that?
    ,Helmer,
      Rank. Let your wife go dressed just as she
      is in everyday life.
    ,Rank,
      Helmer. That was really very prettily
      turned. But can't you tell us what you will be?
    ,Helmer,
      Rank. Yes, my dear friend, I have quite
      made up my mind about that.
    ,Rank,
      Helmer. Well?
    ,Helmer,
      Rank. At the next fancy-dress ball I shall
      be invisible.
    ,Rank,
      Helmer. That's a good joke!
    ,Helmer,
      Rank. There is a big black hat--have you
      never heard of hats that make you invisible? If you put one on, no one can
      see you.
    ,Rank,
      Helmer [suppressing
      a smile]. Yes, you are quite right.
    ,Helmer ,[suppressing
      a smile],
      Rank. But I am clean forgetting what I came
      for. Helmer, give me a cigar--one of the dark Havanas.
    ,Rank,
      Helmer. With the greatest pleasure. [Offers him his case.]
    ,Helmer,[Offers him his case.],
      Rank [takes a
      cigar and cuts off the end]. Thanks.
    ,Rank ,[takes a
      cigar and cuts off the end],
      Nora [striking
      a match]. Let me give you a light.
    ,Nora ,[striking
      a match],
      Rank. Thank you. [She holds the match for him to light his cigar.]
      And now goodbye!
    ,Rank,[She holds the match for him to light his cigar.],
      Helmer. Goodbye, goodbye, dear old man!
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. Sleep well, Doctor Rank.
    ,Nora,
      Rank. Thank you for that wish.
    ,Rank,
      Nora. Wish me the same.
    ,Nora,
      Rank. You? Well, if you want me to sleep
      well! And thanks for the light. [He nods to
      them both and goes out.]
    ,Rank,[He nods to
      them both and goes out.],
      Helmer [in a
      subdued voice]. He has drunk more than he ought.
    ,Helmer ,[in a
      subdued voice],
      Nora [absently].
      Maybe. [HELMER takes a bunch of keys out of
      his pocket and goes into the hall.] Torvald! what are you going to
      do there?
    ,Nora ,[absently],[HELMER takes a bunch of keys out of
      his pocket and goes into the hall.],
      Helmer. Emptying the letter-box; it is
      quite full; there will be no room to put the newspaper in tomorrow
      morning.
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. Are you going to work tonight?
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. You know quite well I'm not. What
      is this? Someone has been at the lock.
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. At the lock--?
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. Yes, someone has. What can it mean?
      I should never have thought the maid--. Here is a broken hairpin. Nora, it
      is one of yours.
    ,Helmer,
      Nora [quickly].
      Then it must have been the children--
    ,Nora ,[quickly],
      Helmer. Then you must get them out of those
      ways. There, at last I have got it open. [Takes
      out the contents of the letter-box, and calls to the kitchen.]
      Helen!--Helen, put out the light over the front door. [Goes back into the room and shuts the door into
      the hall. He holds out his hand full of letters.] Look at
      that--look what a heap of them there are. [Turning
      them over.] What on earth is that?
    ,Helmer,[Takes
      out the contents of the letter-box, and calls to the kitchen.],[Goes back into the room and shuts the door into
      the hall. He holds out his hand full of letters.],[Turning
      them over.],
      Nora [at the
      window]. The letter--No! Torvald, no!
    ,Nora ,[at the
      window],
      Helmer. Two cards--of Rank's.
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. Of Doctor Rank's?
    ,Nora,
      Helmer [looking
      at them]. Doctor Rank. They were on the top. He must have put them
      in when he went out.
    ,Helmer ,[looking
      at them],
      Nora. Is there anything written on them?
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. There is a black cross over the
      name. Look there--what an uncomfortable idea! It looks as if he were
      announcing his own death.
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. It is just what he is doing.
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. What? Do you know anything about
      it? Has he said anything to you?
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. Yes. He told me that when the cards
      came it would be his leave-taking from us. He means to shut himself up and
      die.
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. My poor old friend! Certainly I
      knew we should not have him very long with us. But so soon! And so he
      hides himself away like a wounded animal.
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. If it has to happen, it is best it
      should be without a word--don't you think so, Torvald?
    ,Nora,
      Helmer [walking
      up and down]. He had so grown into our lives. I can't think of him
      as having gone out of them. He, with his sufferings and his loneliness,
      was like a cloudy background to our sunlit happiness. Well, perhaps it is
      best so. For him, anyway. [Standing still.]
      And perhaps for us too, Nora. We two are thrown quite upon each other now.
      [Puts his arms round her.] My darling
      wife, I don't feel as if I could hold you tight enough. Do you know, Nora,
      I have often wished that you might be threatened by some great danger, so
      that I might risk my life's blood, and everything, for your sake.
    ,Helmer ,[walking
      up and down],[Standing still.],[Puts his arms round her.],
      Nora [disengages
      herself, and says firmly and decidedly]. Now you must read your
      letters, Torvald.
    ,Nora ,[disengages
      herself, and says firmly and decidedly],
      Helmer. No, no; not tonight. I want to be
      with you, my darling wife.
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. With the thought of your friend's
      death--
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. You are right, it has affected us
      both. Something ugly has come between us--the thought of the horrors of
      death. We must try and rid our minds of that. Until then--we will each go
      to our own room.
    ,Helmer,
      Nora [hanging
      on his neck]. Goodnight, Torvald--Goodnight!
    ,Nora ,[hanging
      on his neck],
      Helmer [kissing
      her on the forehead]. Goodnight, my little singing-bird. Sleep
      sound, Nora. Now I will read my letters through. [He takes his letters and goes into his room,
      shutting the door after him.]
    ,Helmer ,[kissing
      her on the forehead],[He takes his letters and goes into his room,
      shutting the door after him.],
      Nora [gropes
      distractedly about, seizes HELMER'S domino, throws it round her, while she
      says in quick, hoarse, spasmodic whispers]. Never to see him again.
      Never! Never! [Puts her shawl over her head.]
      Never to see my children again either--never again. Never! Never!--Ah! the
      icy, black water--the unfathomable depths--If only it were over! He has
      got it now--now he is reading it. Goodbye, Torvald and my children! [She is about to rush out through the hall, when
      HELMER opens his door hurriedly and stands with an open letter in his
      hand.]
    ,Nora ,[gropes
      distractedly about, seizes HELMER'S domino, throws it round her, while she
      says in quick, hoarse, spasmodic whispers],[Puts her shawl over her head.],[She is about to rush out through the hall, when
      HELMER opens his door hurriedly and stands with an open letter in his
      hand.],
      Helmer. Nora!
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. Ah!--
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. What is this? Do you know what is
      in this letter?
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. Yes, I know. Let me go! Let me get
      out!
    ,Nora,
      Helmer [holding
      her back]. Where are you going?
    ,Helmer ,[holding
      her back],
      Nora [trying
      to get free]. You shan't save me, Torvald!
    ,Nora ,[trying
      to get free],
      Helmer [reeling].
      True? Is this true, that I read here? Horrible! No, no--it is impossible
      that it can be true.
    ,Helmer ,[reeling],
      Nora. It is true. I have loved you above
      everything else in the world.
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. Oh, don't let us have any silly
      excuses.
    ,Helmer,
      Nora [taking
      a step towards him]. Torvald--!
    ,Nora ,[taking
      a step towards him],
      Helmer. Miserable creature--what have you
      done?
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. Let me go. You shall not suffer for
      my sake. You shall not take it upon yourself.
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. No tragic airs, please. [Locks the hall door.] Here you shall stay
      and give me an explanation. Do you understand what you have done? Answer
      me! Do you understand what you have done?
    ,Helmer,[Locks the hall door.],
      Nora [looks
      steadily at him and says with a growing look of coldness in her face].
      Yes, now I am beginning to understand thoroughly.
    ,Nora ,[looks
      steadily at him and says with a growing look of coldness in her face],
      Helmer [walking
      about the room]. What a horrible awakening! All these eight
      years--she who was my joy and pride--a hypocrite, a liar--worse, worse--a
      criminal! The unutterable ugliness of it all!--For shame! For shame! [NORA is silent and looks steadily at him. He
      stops in front of her.] I ought to have suspected that something of
      the sort would happen. I ought to have foreseen it. All your father's want
      of principle--be silent!--all your father's want of principle has come out
      in you. No religion, no morality, no sense of duty--. How I am punished
      for having winked at what he did! I did it for your sake, and this is how
      you repay me.
    ,Helmer ,[walking
      about the room],[NORA is silent and looks steadily at him. He
      stops in front of her.],
      Nora. Yes, that's just it.
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. Now you have destroyed all my
      happiness. You have ruined all my future. It is horrible to think of! I am
      in the power of an unscrupulous man; he can do what he likes with me, ask
      anything he likes of me, give me any orders he pleases--I dare not refuse.
      And I must sink to such miserable depths because of a thoughtless woman!
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. When I am out of the way, you will be
      free.
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. No fine speeches, please. Your
      father had always plenty of those ready, too. What good would it be to me
      if you were out of the way, as you say? Not the slightest. He can make the
      affair known everywhere; and if he does, I may be falsely suspected of
      having been a party to your criminal action. Very likely people will think
      I was behind it all--that it was I who prompted you! And I have to thank
      you for all this--you whom I have cherished during the whole of our
      married life. Do you understand now what it is you have done for me?
    ,Helmer,
      Nora [coldly
      and quietly]. Yes.
    ,Nora ,[coldly
      and quietly],
      Helmer. It is so incredible that I can't
      take it in. But we must come to some understanding. Take off that shawl.
      Take it off, I tell you. I must try and appease him some way or another.
      The matter must be hushed up at any cost. And as for you and me, it must
      appear as if everything between us were just as before--but naturally only
      in the eyes of the world. You will still remain in my house, that is a
      matter of course. But I shall not allow you to bring up the children; I
      dare not trust them to you. To think that I should be obliged to say so to
      one whom I have loved so dearly, and whom I still--. No, that is all over.
      From this moment happiness is not the question; all that concerns us is to
      save the remains, the fragments, the appearance--
    ,Helmer,
      [A ring is heard at the front-door bell.]
    ,[A ring is heard at the front-door bell.],
      Helmer [with
      a start]. What is that? So late! Can the worst--? Can he--? Hide
      yourself, Nora. Say you are ill.
    ,Helmer ,[with
      a start],
      [NORA stands motionless. HELMER goes and
      unlocks the hall door.]
    ,[NORA stands motionless. HELMER goes and
      unlocks the hall door.],
      Maid [half-dressed,
      comes to the door]. A letter for the mistress.
    ,Maid ,[half-dressed,
      comes to the door],
      Helmer. Give it to me. [Takes the letter, and shuts the door.]
      Yes, it is from him. You shall not have it; I will read it myself.
    ,Helmer,[Takes the letter, and shuts the door.],
      Nora. Yes, read it.
    ,Nora,
      Helmer [standing
      by the lamp]. I scarcely have the courage to do it. It may mean
      ruin for both of us. No, I must know. [Tears
      open the letter, runs his eye over a few lines, looks at a paper enclosed,
      and gives a shout of joy.] Nora! [She
      looks at him questioningly.] Nora!--No, I must read it once
      again--. Yes, it is true! I am saved! Nora, I am saved!
    ,Helmer ,[standing
      by the lamp],[Tears
      open the letter, runs his eye over a few lines, looks at a paper enclosed,
      and gives a shout of joy.],[She
      looks at him questioningly.],
      Nora. And I?
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. You too, of course; we are both
      saved, both you and I. Look, he sends you your bond back. He says he
      regrets and repents--that a happy change in his life--never mind what he
      says! We are saved, Nora! No one can do anything to you. Oh, Nora,
      Nora!--no, first I must destroy these hateful things. Let me see--. [Takes a look at the bond.] No, no, I won't
      look at it. The whole thing shall be nothing but a bad dream to me. [Tears up the bond and both letters, throws them
      all into the stove, and watches them burn.] There--now it doesn't
      exist any longer. He says that since Christmas Eve you--. These must have
      been three dreadful days for you, Nora.
    ,Helmer,[Takes a look at the bond.],[Tears up the bond and both letters, throws them
      all into the stove, and watches them burn.],
      Nora. I have fought a hard fight these
      three days.
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. And suffered agonies, and seen no
      way out but--. No, we won't call any of the horrors to mind. We will only
      shout with joy, and keep saying, "It's all over! It's all over!" Listen to
      me, Nora. You don't seem to realise that it is all over. What is
      this?--such a cold, set face! My poor little Nora, I quite understand; you
      don't feel as if you could believe that I have forgiven you. But it is
      true, Nora, I swear it; I have forgiven you everything. I know that what
      you did, you did out of love for me.
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. That is true.
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. You have loved me as a wife ought
      to love her husband. Only you had not sufficient knowledge to judge of the
      means you used. But do you suppose you are any the less dear to me,
      because you don't understand how to act on your own responsibility? No,
      no; only lean on me; I will advise you and direct you. I should not be a
      man if this womanly helplessness did not just give you a double
      attractiveness in my eyes. You must not think anymore about the hard
      things I said in my first moment of consternation, when I thought
      everything was going to overwhelm me. I have forgiven you, Nora; I swear
      to you I have forgiven you.
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. Thank you for your forgiveness. [She goes out through the door to the right.]
    ,Nora,[She goes out through the door to the right.],
      Helmer. No, don't go--. [Looks in.] What are you doing in there?
    ,Helmer,[Looks in.],
      Nora [from
      within]. Taking off my fancy dress.
    ,Nora ,[from
      within],
      Helmer [standing
      at the open door]. Yes, do. Try and calm yourself, and make your
      mind easy again, my frightened little singing-bird. Be at rest, and feel
      secure; I have broad wings to shelter you under. [Walks up and down by the door.] How warm
      and cosy our home is, Nora. Here is shelter for you; here I will protect
      you like a hunted dove that I have saved from a hawk's claws; I will bring
      peace to your poor beating heart. It will come, little by little, Nora,
      believe me. Tomorrow morning you will look upon it all quite differently;
      soon everything will be just as it was before. Very soon you won't need me
      to assure you that I have forgiven you; you will yourself feel the
      certainty that I have done so. Can you suppose I should ever think of such
      a thing as repudiating you, or even reproaching you? You have no idea what
      a true man's heart is like, Nora. There is something so indescribably
      sweet and satisfying, to a man, in the knowledge that he has forgiven his
      wife--forgiven her freely, and with all his heart. It seems as if that had
      made her, as it were, doubly his own; he has given her a new life, so to
      speak; and she has in a way become both wife and child to him. So you
      shall be for me after this, my little scared, helpless darling. Have no
      anxiety about anything, Nora; only be frank and open with me, and I will
      serve as will and conscience both to you--. What is this? Not gone to bed?
      Have you changed your things?
    ,Helmer ,[standing
      at the open door],[Walks up and down by the door.],
      Nora [in
      everyday dress]. Yes, Torvald, I have changed my things now.
    ,Nora ,[in
      everyday dress],
      Helmer. But what for?--so late as this.
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. I shall not sleep tonight.
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. But, my dear Nora--
    ,Helmer,
      Nora [looking
      at her watch]. It is not so very late. Sit down here, Torvald. You
      and I have much to say to one another. [She
      sits down at one side of the table.]
    ,Nora ,[looking
      at her watch],[She
      sits down at one side of the table.],
      Helmer. Nora--what is this?--this cold, set
      face?
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. Sit down. It will take some time; I
      have a lot to talk over with you.
    ,Nora,
      Helmer [sits
      down at the opposite side of the table]. You alarm me, Nora!--and I
      don't understand you.
    ,Helmer ,[sits
      down at the opposite side of the table],
      Nora. No, that is just it. You don't
      understand me, and I have never understood you either--before tonight. No,
      you mustn't interrupt me. You must simply listen to what I say. Torvald,
      this is a settling of accounts.
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. What do you mean by that?
    ,Helmer,
      Nora [after a
      short silence]. Isn't there one thing that strikes you as strange
      in our sitting here like this?
    ,Nora ,[after a
      short silence],
      Helmer. What is that?
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. We have been married now eight years.
      Does it not occur to you that this is the first time we two, you and I,
      husband and wife, have had a serious conversation?
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. What do you mean by serious?
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. In all these eight years--longer than
      that--from the very beginning of our acquaintance, we have never exchanged
      a word on any serious subject.
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. Was it likely that I would be
      continually and forever telling you about worries that you could not help
      me to bear?
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. I am not speaking about business
      matters. I say that we have never sat down in earnest together to try and
      get at the bottom of anything.
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. But, dearest Nora, would it have
      been any good to you?
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. That is just it; you have never
      understood me. I have been greatly wronged, Torvald--first by papa and
      then by you.
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. What! By us two--by us two, who
      have loved you better than anyone else in the world?
    ,Helmer,
      Nora [shaking
      her head]. You have never loved me. You have only thought it
      pleasant to be in love with me.
    ,Nora ,[shaking
      her head],
      Helmer. Nora, what do I hear you saying?
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. It is perfectly true, Torvald. When I
      was at home with papa, he told me his opinion about everything, and so I
      had the same opinions; and if I differed from him I concealed the fact,
      because he would not have liked it. He called me his doll-child, and he
      played with me just as I used to play with my dolls. And when I came to
      live with you--
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. What sort of an expression is that
      to use about our marriage?
    ,Helmer,
      Nora [undisturbed].
      I mean that I was simply transferred from papa's hands into yours. You
      arranged everything according to your own taste, and so I got the same
      tastes as you--or else I pretended to, I am really not quite sure which--I
      think sometimes the one and sometimes the other. When I look back on it,
      it seems to me as if I had been living here like a poor woman--just from
      hand to mouth. I have existed merely to perform tricks for you, Torvald.
      But you would have it so. You and papa have committed a great sin against
      me. It is your fault that I have made nothing of my life.
    ,Nora ,[undisturbed],
      Helmer. How unreasonable and how ungrateful
      you are, Nora! Have you not been happy here?
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. No, I have never been happy. I
      thought I was, but it has never really been so.
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. Not--not happy!
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. No, only merry. And you have always
      been so kind to me. But our home has been nothing but a playroom. I have
      been your doll-wife, just as at home I was papa's doll-child; and here the
      children have been my dolls. I thought it great fun when you played with
      me, just as they thought it great fun when I played with them. That is
      what our marriage has been, Torvald.
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. There is some truth in what you
      say--exaggerated and strained as your view of it is. But for the future it
      shall be different. Playtime shall be over, and lesson-time shall begin.
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. Whose lessons? Mine, or the
      children's?
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. Both yours and the children's, my
      darling Nora.
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. Alas, Torvald, you are not the man to
      educate me into being a proper wife for you.
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. And you can say that!
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. And I--how am I fitted to bring up
      the children?
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. Nora!
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. Didn't you say so yourself a little
      while ago--that you dare not trust me to bring them up?
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. In a moment of anger! Why do you
      pay any heed to that?
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. Indeed, you were perfectly right. I
      am not fit for the task. There is another task I must undertake first. I
      must try and educate myself--you are not the man to help me in that. I
      must do that for myself. And that is why I am going to leave you now.
    ,Nora,
      Helmer [springing
      up]. What do you say?
    ,Helmer ,[springing
      up],
      Nora. I must stand quite alone, if I am to
      understand myself and everything about me. It is for that reason that I
      cannot remain with you any longer.
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. Nora, Nora!
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. I am going away from here now, at
      once. I am sure Christine will take me in for the night--
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. You are out of your mind! I won't
      allow it! I forbid you!
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. It is no use forbidding me anything
      any longer. I will take with me what belongs to myself. I will take
      nothing from you, either now or later.
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. What sort of madness is this!
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. Tomorrow I shall go home--I mean, to
      my old home. It will be easiest for me to find something to do there.
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. You blind, foolish woman!
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. I must try and get some sense,
      Torvald.
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. To desert your home, your husband
      and your children! And you don't consider what people will say!
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. I cannot consider that at all. I only
      know that it is necessary for me.
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. It's shocking. This is how you
      would neglect your most sacred duties.
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. What do you consider my most sacred
      duties?
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. Do I need to tell you that? Are
      they not your duties to your husband and your children?
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. I have other duties just as sacred.
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. That you have not. What duties
      could those be?
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. Duties to myself.
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. Before all else, you are a wife and
      a mother.
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. I don't believe that any longer. I
      believe that before all else I am a reasonable human being, just as you
      are--or, at all events, that I must try and become one. I know quite well,
      Torvald, that most people would think you right, and that views of that
      kind are to be found in books; but I can no longer content myself with
      what most people say, or with what is found in books. I must think over
      things for myself and get to understand them.
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. Can you not understand your place
      in your own home? Have you not a reliable guide in such matters as
      that?--have you no religion?
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. I am afraid, Torvald, I do not
      exactly know what religion is.
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. What are you saying?
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. I know nothing but what the clergyman
      said, when I went to be confirmed. He told us that religion was this, and
      that, and the other. When I am away from all this, and am alone, I will
      look into that matter too. I will see if what the clergyman said is true,
      or at all events if it is true for me.
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. This is unheard of in a girl of
      your age! But if religion cannot lead you aright, let me try and awaken
      your conscience. I suppose you have some moral sense? Or--answer me--am I
      to think you have none?
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. I assure you, Torvald, that is not an
      easy question to answer. I really don't know. The thing perplexes me
      altogether. I only know that you and I look at it in quite a different
      light. I am learning, too, that the law is quite another thing from what I
      supposed; but I find it impossible to convince myself that the law is
      right. According to it a woman has no right to spare her old dying father,
      or to save her husband's life. I can't believe that.
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. You talk like a child. You don't
      understand the conditions of the world in which you live.
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. No, I don't. But now I am going to
      try. I am going to see if I can make out who is right, the world or I.
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. You are ill, Nora; you are
      delirious; I almost think you are out of your mind.
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. I have never felt my mind so clear
      and certain as tonight.
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. And is it with a clear and certain
      mind that you forsake your husband and your children?
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. Yes, it is.
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. Then there is only one possible
      explanation.
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. What is that?
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. You do not love me anymore.
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. No, that is just it.
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. Nora!--and you can say that?
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. It gives me great pain, Torvald, for
      you have always been so kind to me, but I cannot help it. I do not love
      you any more.
    ,Nora,
      Helmer [regaining
      his composure]. Is that a clear and certain conviction too?
    ,Helmer ,[regaining
      his composure],
      Nora. Yes, absolutely clear and certain.
      That is the reason why I will not stay here any longer.
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. And can you tell me what I have
      done to forfeit your love?
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. Yes, indeed I can. It was tonight,
      when the wonderful thing did not happen; then I saw you were not the man I
      had thought you were.
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. Explain yourself better. I don't
      understand you.
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. I have waited so patiently for eight
      years; for, goodness knows, I knew very well that wonderful things don't
      happen every day. Then this horrible misfortune came upon me; and then I
      felt quite certain that the wonderful thing was going to happen at last.
      When Krogstad's letter was lying out there, never for a moment did I
      imagine that you would consent to accept this man's conditions. I was so
      absolutely certain that you would say to him: Publish the thing to the
      whole world. And when that was done--
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. Yes, what then?--when I had exposed
      my wife to shame and disgrace?
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. When that was done, I was so
      absolutely certain, you would come forward and take everything upon
      yourself, and say: I am the guilty one.
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. Nora--!
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. You mean that I would never have
      accepted such a sacrifice on your part? No, of course not. But what would
      my assurances have been worth against yours? That was the wonderful thing
      which I hoped for and feared; and it was to prevent that, that I wanted to
      kill myself.
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. I would gladly work night and day
      for you, Nora--bear sorrow and want for your sake. But no man would
      sacrifice his honour for the one he loves.
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. It is a thing hundreds of thousands
      of women have done.
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. Oh, you think and talk like a
      heedless child.
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. Maybe. But you neither think nor talk
      like the man I could bind myself to. As soon as your fear was over--and it
      was not fear for what threatened me, but for what might happen to
      you--when the whole thing was past, as far as you were concerned it was
      exactly as if nothing at all had happened. Exactly as before, I was your
      little skylark, your doll, which you would in future treat with doubly
      gentle care, because it was so brittle and fragile. [Getting up.] Torvald--it was then it
      dawned upon me that for eight years I had been living here with a strange
      man, and had borne him three children--. Oh, I can't bear to think of it!
      I could tear myself into little bits!
    ,Nora,[Getting up.],
      Helmer [sadly].
      I see, I see. An abyss has opened between us--there is no denying it. But,
      Nora, would it not be possible to fill it up?
    ,Helmer ,[sadly],
      Nora. As I am now, I am no wife for you.
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. I have it in me to become a
      different man.
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. Perhaps--if your doll is taken away
      from you.
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. But to part!--to part from you! No,
      no, Nora, I can't understand that idea.
    ,Helmer,
      Nora [going
      out to the right]. That makes it all the more certain that it must
      be done. [She comes back with her cloak and
      hat and a small bag which she puts on a chair by the table.]
    ,Nora ,[going
      out to the right],[She comes back with her cloak and
      hat and a small bag which she puts on a chair by the table.],
      Helmer. Nora, Nora, not now! Wait until
      tomorrow.
    ,Helmer,
      Nora [putting
      on her cloak]. I cannot spend the night in a strange man's room.
    ,Nora ,[putting
      on her cloak],
      Helmer. But can't we live here like brother
      and sister--?
    ,Helmer,
      Nora [putting
      on her hat]. You know very well that would not last long. [Puts the shawl round her.] Goodbye,
      Torvald. I won't see the little ones. I know they are in better hands than
      mine. As I am now, I can be of no use to them.
    ,Nora ,[putting
      on her hat],[Puts the shawl round her.],
      Helmer. But some day, Nora--some day?
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. How can I tell? I have no idea what
      is going to become of me.
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. But you are my wife, whatever
      becomes of you.
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. Listen, Torvald. I have heard that
      when a wife deserts her husband's house, as I am doing now, he is legally
      freed from all obligations towards her. In any case, I set you free from
      all your obligations. You are not to feel yourself bound in the slightest
      way, any more than I shall. There must be perfect freedom on both sides.
      See, here is your ring back. Give me mine.
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. That too?
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. That too.
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. Here it is.
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. That's right. Now it is all over. I
      have put the keys here. The maids know all about everything in the
      house--better than I do. Tomorrow, after I have left her, Christine will
      come here and pack up my own things that I brought with me from home. I
      will have them sent after me.
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. All over! All over!--Nora, shall
      you never think of me again?
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. I know I shall often think of you,
      the children, and this house.
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. May I write to you, Nora?
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. No--never. You must not do that.
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. But at least let me send you--
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. Nothing--nothing--
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. Let me help you if you are in want.
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. No. I can receive nothing from a
      stranger.
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. Nora--can I never be anything more
      than a stranger to you?
    ,Helmer,
      Nora [taking
      her bag]. Ah, Torvald, the most wonderful thing of all would have
      to happen.
    ,Nora ,[taking
      her bag],
      Helmer. Tell me what that would be!
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. Both you and I would have to be so
      changed that--. Oh, Torvald, I don't believe any longer in wonderful
      things happening.
    ,Nora,
      Helmer. But I will believe in it. Tell me!
      So changed that--?
    ,Helmer,
      Nora. That our life together would be a
      real wedlock. Goodbye. [She goes out through
      the hall.]
    ,Nora,[She goes out through
      the hall.],
      Helmer [sinks
      down on a chair at the door and buries his face in his hands].
      Nora! Nora! [Looks round, and rises.]
      Empty. She is gone. [A hope flashes across
      his mind.] The most wonderful thing of all--?

      down on a chair at the door and buries his face in his hands],[Looks round, and rises.],[A hope flashes across

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
