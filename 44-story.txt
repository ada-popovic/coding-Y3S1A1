      INTRODUCTION BY MRS FORSTER-NIETZSCHE.
    ,
      HOW ZARATHUSTRA CAME INTO BEING.
    ,
      “Zarathustra” is my brother’s most personal work; it is the history of his
      most individual experiences, of his friendships, ideals, raptures,
      bitterest disappointments and sorrows. Above it all, however, there soars,
      transfiguring it, the image of his greatest hopes and remotest aims. My
      brother had the figure of Zarathustra in his mind from his very earliest
      youth: he once told me that even as a child he had dreamt of him. At
      different periods in his life, he would call this haunter of his dreams by
      different names; “but in the end,” he declares in a note on the subject,
      “I had to do a PERSIAN the honour of identifying him with this creature of
      my fancy. Persians were the first to take a broad and comprehensive view
      of history. Every series of evolutions, according to them, was presided
      over by a prophet; and every prophet had his ‘Hazar,’—his dynasty of
      a thousand years.”
     ,
      All Zarathustra’s views, as also his personality, were early conceptions
      of my brother’s mind. Whoever reads his posthumously published writings
      for the years 1869-82 with care, will constantly meet with passages
      suggestive of Zarathustra’s thoughts and doctrines. For instance, the
      ideal of the Superman is put forth quite clearly in all his writings
      during the years 1873-75; and in “We Philologists”, the following
      remarkable observations occur:—
    ,
      “How can one praise and glorify a nation as a whole?—Even among the
      Greeks, it was the INDIVIDUALS that counted.”
     ,
      “The Greeks are interesting and extremely important because they reared
      such a vast number of great individuals. How was this possible? The
      question is one which ought to be studied.
    ,
      “I am interested only in the relations of a people to the rearing of the
      individual man, and among the Greeks the conditions were unusually
      favourable for the development of the individual; not by any means owing
      to the goodness of the people, but because of the struggles of their evil
      instincts.
    ,
      “WITH THE HELP OF FAVOURABLE MEASURES GREAT INDIVIDUALS MIGHT BE REARED
      WHO WOULD BE BOTH DIFFERENT FROM AND HIGHER THAN THOSE WHO HERETOFORE HAVE
      OWED THEIR EXISTENCE TO MERE CHANCE. Here we may still be hopeful: in the
      rearing of exceptional men.”
     ,
      The notion of rearing the Superman is only a new form of an ideal
      Nietzsche already had in his youth, that “THE OBJECT OF MANKIND SHOULD LIE
      IN ITS HIGHEST INDIVIDUALS” (or, as he writes in “Schopenhauer as
      Educator”: “Mankind ought constantly to be striving to produce great men—this
      and nothing else is its duty.”) But the ideals he most revered in those
      days are no longer held to be the highest types of men. No, around this
      future ideal of a coming humanity—the Superman—the poet spread
      the veil of becoming. Who can tell to what glorious heights man can still
      ascend? That is why, after having tested the worth of our noblest ideal—that
      of the Saviour, in the light of the new valuations, the poet cries with
      passionate emphasis in “Zarathustra”:
    ,
      “Never yet hath there been a Superman. Naked have I seen both of them, the
      greatest and the smallest man:—
    ,
      All-too-similar are they still to each other. Verily even the greatest
      found I—all-too-human!”—
    ,
      The phrase “the rearing of the Superman,” has very often been
      misunderstood. By the word “rearing,” in this case, is meant the act of
      modifying by means of new and higher values—values which, as laws
      and guides of conduct and opinion, are now to rule over mankind. In
      general the doctrine of the Superman can only be understood correctly in
      conjunction with other ideas of the author’s, such as:—the Order of
      Rank, the Will to Power, and the Transvaluation of all Values. He assumes
      that Christianity, as a product of the resentment of the botched and the
      weak, has put in ban all that is beautiful, strong, proud, and powerful,
      in fact all the qualities resulting from strength, and that, in
      consequence, all forces which tend to promote or elevate life have been
      seriously undermined. Now, however, a new table of valuations must be
      placed over mankind—namely, that of the strong, mighty, and
      magnificent man, overflowing with life and elevated to his zenith—the
      Superman, who is now put before us with overpowering passion as the aim of
      our life, hope, and will. And just as the old system of valuing, which
      only extolled the qualities favourable to the weak, the suffering, and the
      oppressed, has succeeded in producing a weak, suffering, and “modern”
       race, so this new and reversed system of valuing ought to rear a healthy,
      strong, lively, and courageous type, which would be a glory to life
      itself. Stated briefly, the leading principle of this new system of
      valuing would be: “All that proceeds from power is good, all that springs
      from weakness is bad.”
     ,
      This type must not be regarded as a fanciful figure: it is not a nebulous
      hope which is to be realised at some indefinitely remote period, thousands
      of years hence; nor is it a new species (in the Darwinian sense) of which
      we can know nothing, and which it would therefore be somewhat absurd to
      strive after. But it is meant to be a possibility which men of the present
      could realise with all their spiritual and physical energies, provided
      they adopted the new values.
    ,
      The author of “Zarathustra” never lost sight of that egregious example of
      a transvaluation of all values through Christianity, whereby the whole of
      the deified mode of life and thought of the Greeks, as well as strong
      Romedom, was almost annihilated or transvalued in a comparatively short
      time. Could not a rejuvenated Graeco-Roman system of valuing (once it had
      been refined and made more profound by the schooling which two thousand
      years of Christianity had provided) effect another such revolution within
      a calculable period of time, until that glorious type of manhood shall
      finally appear which is to be our new faith and hope, and in the creation
      of which Zarathustra exhorts us to participate?
    ,
      In his private notes on the subject the author uses the expression
      “Superman” (always in the singular, by-the-bye), as signifying “the most
      thoroughly well-constituted type,” as opposed to “modern man”; above all,
      however, he designates Zarathustra himself as an example of the Superman.
      In “Ecco Homo” he is careful to enlighten us concerning the precursors and
      prerequisites to the advent of this highest type, in referring to a
      certain passage in the “Gay Science”:—
    ,
      “In order to understand this type, we must first be quite clear in regard
      to the leading physiological condition on which it depends: this condition
      is what I call GREAT HEALTHINESS. I know not how to express my meaning
      more plainly or more personally than I have done already in one of the
      last chapters (Aphorism 382) of the fifth book of the ‘Gaya Scienza’.”
     ,
      “We, the new, the nameless, the hard-to-understand,”—it says there,—“we
      firstlings of a yet untried future—we require for a new end also a
      new means, namely, a new healthiness, stronger, sharper, tougher, bolder
      and merrier than all healthiness hitherto. He whose soul longeth to
      experience the whole range of hitherto recognised values and
      desirabilities, and to circumnavigate all the coasts of this ideal
      ‘Mediterranean Sea’, who, from the adventures of his most personal
      experience, wants to know how it feels to be a conqueror, and discoverer
      of the ideal—as likewise how it is with the artist, the saint, the
      legislator, the sage, the scholar, the devotee, the prophet, and the godly
      non-conformist of the old style:—requires one thing above all for
      that purpose, GREAT HEALTHINESS—such healthiness as one not only
      possesses, but also constantly acquires and must acquire, because one
      unceasingly sacrifices it again, and must sacrifice it!—And now,
      after having been long on the way in this fashion, we Argonauts of the
      ideal, more courageous perhaps than prudent, and often enough shipwrecked
      and brought to grief, nevertheless dangerously healthy, always healthy
      again,—it would seem as if, in recompense for it all, that we have a
      still undiscovered country before us, the boundaries of which no one has
      yet seen, a beyond to all countries and corners of the ideal known
      hitherto, a world so over-rich in the beautiful, the strange, the
      questionable, the frightful, and the divine, that our curiosity as well as
      our thirst for possession thereof, have got out of hand—alas! that
      nothing will now any longer satisfy us!—
    ,
      “How could we still be content with THE MAN OF THE PRESENT DAY after such
      outlooks, and with such a craving in our conscience and consciousness? Sad
      enough; but it is unavoidable that we should look on the worthiest aims
      and hopes of the man of the present day with ill-concealed amusement, and
      perhaps should no longer look at them. Another ideal runs on before us, a
      strange, tempting ideal full of danger, to which we should not like to
      persuade any one, because we do not so readily acknowledge any one’s RIGHT
      THERETO: the ideal of a spirit who plays naively (that is to say
      involuntarily and from overflowing abundance and power) with everything
      that has hitherto been called holy, good, intangible, or divine; to whom
      the loftiest conception which the people have reasonably made their
      measure of value, would already practically imply danger, ruin, abasement,
      or at least relaxation, blindness, or temporary self-forgetfulness; the
      ideal of a humanly superhuman welfare and benevolence, which will often
      enough appear INHUMAN, for example, when put alongside of all past
      seriousness on earth, and alongside of all past solemnities in bearing,
      word, tone, look, morality, and pursuit, as their truest involuntary
      parody—and WITH which, nevertheless, perhaps THE GREAT SERIOUSNESS
      only commences, when the proper interrogative mark is set up, the fate of
      the soul changes, the hour-hand moves, and tragedy begins...”
     ,
      Although the figure of Zarathustra and a large number of the leading
      thoughts in this work had appeared much earlier in the dreams and writings
      of the author, “Thus Spake Zarathustra” did not actually come into being
      until the month of August 1881 in Sils Maria; and it was the idea of the
      Eternal Recurrence of all things which finally induced my brother to set
      forth his new views in poetic language. In regard to his first conception
      of this idea, his autobiographical sketch, “Ecce Homo”, written in the
      autumn of 1888, contains the following passage:—
    ,
      “The fundamental idea of my work—namely, the Eternal Recurrence of
      all things—this highest of all possible formulae of a Yea-saying
      philosophy, first occurred to me in August 1881. I made a note of the
      thought on a sheet of paper, with the postscript: 6,000 feet beyond men
      and time! That day I happened to be wandering through the woods alongside
      of the lake of Silvaplana, and I halted beside a huge, pyramidal and
      towering rock not far from Surlei. It was then that the thought struck me.
      Looking back now, I find that exactly two months previous to this
      inspiration, I had had an omen of its coming in the form of a sudden and
      decisive alteration in my tastes—more particularly in music. It
      would even be possible to consider all ‘Zarathustra’ as a musical
      composition. At all events, a very necessary condition in its production
      was a renaissance in myself of the art of hearing. In a small mountain
      resort (Recoaro) near Vicenza, where I spent the spring of 1881, I and my
      friend and Maestro, Peter Gast—also one who had been born again—discovered
      that the phoenix music that hovered over us, wore lighter and brighter
      plumes than it had done theretofore.”
     ,
      During the month of August 1881 my brother resolved to reveal the teaching
      of the Eternal Recurrence, in dithyrambic and psalmodic form, through the
      mouth of Zarathustra. Among the notes of this period, we found a page on
      which is written the first definite plan of “Thus Spake Zarathustra”:—
    ,
      “MIDDAY AND ETERNITY.” “GUIDE-POSTS TO A NEW WAY OF LIVING.”
     ,
      Beneath this is written:—
    ,
      “Zarathustra born on lake Urmi; left his home in his thirtieth year, went
      into the province of Aria, and, during ten years of solitude in the
      mountains, composed the Zend-Avesta.”
     ,
      “The sun of knowledge stands once more at midday; and the serpent of
      eternity lies coiled in its light—: It is YOUR time, ye midday
      brethren.”
     ,
      In that summer of 1881, my brother, after many years of steadily declining
      health, began at last to rally, and it is to this first gush of the
      recovery of his once splendid bodily condition that we owe not only “The
      Gay Science”, which in its mood may be regarded as a prelude to
      “Zarathustra”, but also “Zarathustra” itself. Just as he was beginning to
      recuperate his health, however, an unkind destiny brought him a number of
      most painful personal experiences. His friends caused him many
      disappointments, which were the more bitter to him, inasmuch as he
      regarded friendship as such a sacred institution; and for the first time
      in his life he realised the whole horror of that loneliness to which,
      perhaps, all greatness is condemned. But to be forsaken is something very
      different from deliberately choosing blessed loneliness. How he longed, in
      those days, for the ideal friend who would thoroughly understand him, to
      whom he would be able to say all, and whom he imagined he had found at
      various periods in his life from his earliest youth onwards. Now, however,
      that the way he had chosen grew ever more perilous and steep, he found
      nobody who could follow him: he therefore created a perfect friend for
      himself in the ideal form of a majestic philosopher, and made this
      creation the preacher of his gospel to the world.
    ,
      Whether my brother would ever have written “Thus Spake Zarathustra”
       according to the first plan sketched in the summer of 1881, if he had not
      had the disappointments already referred to, is now an idle question; but
      perhaps where “Zarathustra” is concerned, we may also say with Master
      Eckhardt: “The fleetest beast to bear you to perfection is suffering.”
     ,
      My brother writes as follows about the origin of the first part of
      “Zarathustra”:—“In the winter of 1882-83, I was living on the
      charming little Gulf of Rapallo, not far from Genoa, and between Chiavari
      and Cape Porto Fino. My health was not very good; the winter was cold and
      exceptionally rainy; and the small inn in which I lived was so close to
      the water that at night my sleep would be disturbed if the sea were high.
      These circumstances were surely the very reverse of favourable; and yet in
      spite of it all, and as if in demonstration of my belief that everything
      decisive comes to life in spite of every obstacle, it was precisely during
      this winter and in the midst of these unfavourable circumstances that my
      ‘Zarathustra’ originated. In the morning I used to start out in a
      southerly direction up the glorious road to Zoagli, which rises aloft
      through a forest of pines and gives one a view far out into the sea. In
      the afternoon, as often as my health permitted, I walked round the whole
      bay from Santa Margherita to beyond Porto Fino. This spot was all the more
      interesting to me, inasmuch as it was so dearly loved by the Emperor
      Frederick III. In the autumn of 1886 I chanced to be there again when he
      was revisiting this small, forgotten world of happiness for the last time.
      It was on these two roads that all ‘Zarathustra’ came to me, above all
      Zarathustra himself as a type;—I ought rather to say that it was on
      these walks that these ideas waylaid me.”
     ,
      The first part of “Zarathustra” was written in about ten days—that
      is to say, from the beginning to about the middle of February 1883. “The
      last lines were written precisely in the hallowed hour when Richard Wagner
      gave up the ghost in Venice.”
     ,
      With the exception of the ten days occupied in composing the first part of
      this book, my brother often referred to this winter as the hardest and
      sickliest he had ever experienced. He did not, however, mean thereby that
      his former disorders were troubling him, but that he was suffering from a
      severe attack of influenza which he had caught in Santa Margherita, and
      which tormented him for several weeks after his arrival in Genoa. As a
      matter of fact, however, what he complained of most was his spiritual
      condition—that indescribable forsakenness—to which he gives
      such heartrending expression in “Zarathustra”. Even the reception which
      the first part met with at the hands of friends and acquaintances was
      extremely disheartening: for almost all those to whom he presented copies
      of the work misunderstood it. “I found no one ripe for many of my
      thoughts; the case of ‘Zarathustra’ proves that one can speak with the
      utmost clearness, and yet not be heard by any one.” My brother was very
      much discouraged by the feebleness of the response he was given, and as he
      was striving just then to give up the practice of taking hydrate of
      chloral—a drug he had begun to take while ill with influenza,—the
      following spring, spent in Rome, was a somewhat gloomy one for him. He
      writes about it as follows:—“I spent a melancholy spring in Rome,
      where I only just managed to live,—and this was no easy matter. This
      city, which is absolutely unsuited to the poet-author of ‘Zarathustra’,
      and for the choice of which I was not responsible, made me inordinately
      miserable. I tried to leave it. I wanted to go to Aquila—the
      opposite of Rome in every respect, and actually founded in a spirit of
      enmity towards that city (just as I also shall found a city some day), as
      a memento of an atheist and genuine enemy of the Church—a person
      very closely related to me,—the great Hohenstaufen, the Emperor
      Frederick II. But Fate lay behind it all: I had to return again to Rome.
      In the end I was obliged to be satisfied with the Piazza Barberini, after
      I had exerted myself in vain to find an anti-Christian quarter. I fear
      that on one occasion, to avoid bad smells as much as possible, I actually
      inquired at the Palazzo del Quirinale whether they could not provide a
      quiet room for a philosopher. In a chamber high above the Piazza just
      mentioned, from which one obtained a general view of Rome and could hear
      the fountains plashing far below, the loneliest of all songs was composed—‘The
      Night-Song’. About this time I was obsessed by an unspeakably sad melody,
      the refrain of which I recognised in the words, ‘dead through
      immortality.’”
     ,
      We remained somewhat too long in Rome that spring, and what with the
      effect of the increasing heat and the discouraging circumstances already
      described, my brother resolved not to write any more, or in any case, not
      to proceed with “Zarathustra”, although I offered to relieve him of all
      trouble in connection with the proofs and the publisher. When, however, we
      returned to Switzerland towards the end of June, and he found himself once
      more in the familiar and exhilarating air of the mountains, all his joyous
      creative powers revived, and in a note to me announcing the dispatch of
      some manuscript, he wrote as follows: “I have engaged a place here for
      three months: forsooth, I am the greatest fool to allow my courage to be
      sapped from me by the climate of Italy. Now and again I am troubled by the
      thought: WHAT NEXT? My ‘future’ is the darkest thing in the world to me,
      but as there still remains a great deal for me to do, I suppose I ought
      rather to think of doing this than of my future, and leave the rest to
      THEE and the gods.”
     ,
      The second part of “Zarathustra” was written between the 26th of June and
      the 6th July. “This summer, finding myself once more in the sacred place
      where the first thought of ‘Zarathustra’ flashed across my mind, I
      conceived the second part. Ten days sufficed. Neither for the second, the
      first, nor the third part, have I required a day longer.”
     ,
      He often used to speak of the ecstatic mood in which he wrote
      “Zarathustra”; how in his walks over hill and dale the ideas would crowd
      into his mind, and how he would note them down hastily in a note-book from
      which he would transcribe them on his return, sometimes working till
      midnight. He says in a letter to me: “You can have no idea of the
      vehemence of such composition,” and in “Ecce Homo” (autumn 1888) he
      describes as follows with passionate enthusiasm the incomparable mood in
      which he created Zarathustra:—
    ,
      “—Has any one at the end of the nineteenth century any distinct
      notion of what poets of a stronger age understood by the word inspiration?
      If not, I will describe it. If one had the smallest vestige of
      superstition in one, it would hardly be possible to set aside completely
      the idea that one is the mere incarnation, mouthpiece or medium of an
      almighty power. The idea of revelation in the sense that something becomes
      suddenly visible and audible with indescribable certainty and accuracy,
      which profoundly convulses and upsets one—describes simply the
      matter of fact. One hears—one does not seek; one takes—one
      does not ask who gives: a thought suddenly flashes up like lightning, it
      comes with necessity, unhesitatingly—I have never had any choice in
      the matter. There is an ecstasy such that the immense strain of it is
      sometimes relaxed by a flood of tears, along with which one’s steps either
      rush or involuntarily lag, alternately. There is the feeling that one is
      completely out of hand, with the very distinct consciousness of an endless
      number of fine thrills and quiverings to the very toes;—there is a
      depth of happiness in which the painfullest and gloomiest do not operate
      as antitheses, but as conditioned, as demanded in the sense of necessary
      shades of colour in such an overflow of light. There is an instinct for
      rhythmic relations which embraces wide areas of forms (length, the need of
      a wide-embracing rhythm, is almost the measure of the force of an
      inspiration, a sort of counterpart to its pressure and tension).
      Everything happens quite involuntarily, as if in a tempestuous outburst of
      freedom, of absoluteness, of power and divinity. The involuntariness of
      the figures and similes is the most remarkable thing; one loses all
      perception of what constitutes the figure and what constitutes the simile;
      everything seems to present itself as the readiest, the correctest and the
      simplest means of expression. It actually seems, to use one of
      Zarathustra’s own phrases, as if all things came unto one, and would fain
      be similes: ‘Here do all things come caressingly to thy talk and flatter
      thee, for they want to ride upon thy back. On every simile dost thou here
      ride to every truth. Here fly open unto thee all being’s words and
      word-cabinets; here all being wanteth to become words, here all becoming
      wanteth to learn of thee how to talk.’ This is MY experience of
      inspiration. I do not doubt but that one would have to go back thousands
      of years in order to find some one who could say to me: It is mine also!—”
     ,
      In the autumn of 1883 my brother left the Engadine for Germany and stayed
      there a few weeks. In the following winter, after wandering somewhat
      erratically through Stresa, Genoa, and Spezia, he landed in Nice, where
      the climate so happily promoted his creative powers that he wrote the
      third part of “Zarathustra”. “In the winter, beneath the halcyon sky of
      Nice, which then looked down upon me for the first time in my life, I
      found the third ‘Zarathustra’—and came to the end of my task; the
      whole having occupied me scarcely a year. Many hidden corners and heights
      in the landscapes round about Nice are hallowed to me by unforgettable
      moments. That decisive chapter entitled ‘Old and New Tables’ was composed
      in the very difficult ascent from the station to Eza—that wonderful
      Moorish village in the rocks. My most creative moments were always
      accompanied by unusual muscular activity. The body is inspired: let us
      waive the question of the ‘soul.’ I might often have been seen dancing in
      those days. Without a suggestion of fatigue I could then walk for seven or
      eight hours on end among the hills. I slept well and laughed well—I
      was perfectly robust and patient.”
     ,
      As we have seen, each of the three parts of “Zarathustra” was written,
      after a more or less short period of preparation, in about ten days. The
      composition of the fourth part alone was broken by occasional
      interruptions. The first notes relating to this part were written while he
      and I were staying together in Zurich in September 1884. In the following
      November, while staying at Mentone, he began to elaborate these notes, and
      after a long pause, finished the manuscript at Nice between the end of
      January and the middle of February 1885. My brother then called this part
      the fourth and last; but even before, and shortly after it had been
      privately printed, he wrote to me saying that he still intended writing a
      fifth and sixth part, and notes relating to these parts are now in my
      possession. This fourth part (the original MS. of which contains this
      note: “Only for my friends, not for the public”) is written in a
      particularly personal spirit, and those few to whom he presented a copy of
      it, he pledged to the strictest secrecy concerning its contents. He often
      thought of making this fourth part public also, but doubted whether he
      would ever be able to do so without considerably altering certain portions
      of it. At all events he resolved to distribute this manuscript production,
      of which only forty copies were printed, only among those who had proved
      themselves worthy of it, and it speaks eloquently of his utter loneliness
      and need of sympathy in those days, that he had occasion to present only
      seven copies of his book according to this resolution.
    ,
      Already at the beginning of this history I hinted at the reasons which led
      my brother to select a Persian as the incarnation of his ideal of the
      majestic philosopher. His reasons, however, for choosing Zarathustra of
      all others to be his mouthpiece, he gives us in the following words:—“People
      have never asked me, as they should have done, what the name Zarathustra
      precisely means in my mouth, in the mouth of the first Immoralist; for
      what distinguishes that philosopher from all others in the past is the
      very fact that he was exactly the reverse of an immoralist. Zarathustra
      was the first to see in the struggle between good and evil the essential
      wheel in the working of things. The translation of morality into the
      metaphysical, as force, cause, end in itself, was HIS work. But the very
      question suggests its own answer. Zarathustra CREATED the most portentous
      error, MORALITY, consequently he should also be the first to PERCEIVE that
      error, not only because he has had longer and greater experience of the
      subject than any other thinker—all history is the experimental
      refutation of the theory of the so-called moral order of things:—the
      more important point is that Zarathustra was more truthful than any other
      thinker. In his teaching alone do we meet with truthfulness upheld as the
      highest virtue—i.e.: the reverse of the COWARDICE of the ‘idealist’ 
      who flees from reality. Zarathustra had more courage in his body than any
      other thinker before or after him. To tell the truth and TO AIM STRAIGHT:
      that is the first Persian virtue. Am I understood?... The overcoming of
      morality through itself—through truthfulness, the overcoming of the
      moralist through his opposite—THROUGH ME—: that is what the
      name Zarathustra means in my mouth.”

      ZARATHUSTRA’S PROLOGUE.
    ,
      1.
    ,
      When Zarathustra was thirty years old, he left his home and the lake of
      his home, and went into the mountains. There he enjoyed his spirit and
      solitude, and for ten years did not weary of it. But at last his heart
      changed,—and rising one morning with the rosy dawn, he went before
      the sun, and spake thus unto it:
    ,
      Thou great star! What would be thy happiness if thou hadst not those for
      whom thou shinest!
    ,
      For ten years hast thou climbed hither unto my cave: thou wouldst have
      wearied of thy light and of the journey, had it not been for me, mine
      eagle, and my serpent.
    ,
      But we awaited thee every morning, took from thee thine overflow and
      blessed thee for it.
    ,
      Lo! I am weary of my wisdom, like the bee that hath gathered too much
      honey; I need hands outstretched to take it.
    ,
      I would fain bestow and distribute, until the wise have once more become
      joyous in their folly, and the poor happy in their riches.
    ,
      Therefore must I descend into the deep: as thou doest in the evening, when
      thou goest behind the sea, and givest light also to the nether-world, thou
      exuberant star!
    ,
      Like thee must I GO DOWN, as men say, to whom I shall descend.
    ,
      Bless me, then, thou tranquil eye, that canst behold even the greatest
      happiness without envy!
    ,
      Bless the cup that is about to overflow, that the water may flow golden
      out of it, and carry everywhere the reflection of thy bliss!
    ,
      Lo! This cup is again going to empty itself, and Zarathustra is again
      going to be a man.
    ,
      Thus began Zarathustra’s down-going.
    ,

      Zarathustra went down the mountain alone, no one meeting him. When he
      entered the forest, however, there suddenly stood before him an old man,
      who had left his holy cot to seek roots. And thus spake the old man to
      Zarathustra:
    ,
      “No stranger to me is this wanderer: many years ago passed he by.
      Zarathustra he was called; but he hath altered.
    ,
      Then thou carriedst thine ashes into the mountains: wilt thou now carry
      thy fire into the valleys? Fearest thou not the incendiary’s doom?
    ,
      Yea, I recognise Zarathustra. Pure is his eye, and no loathing lurketh
      about his mouth. Goeth he not along like a dancer?
    ,
      Altered is Zarathustra; a child hath Zarat
