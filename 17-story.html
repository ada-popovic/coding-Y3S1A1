the Text,For some time back I have felt the want, among Students
of Drawing, of a written code of accurate Perspective Law;
the modes of construction in common use being various, and,
for some problems, insufficient. It would have been desirable
to draw up such a code in popular language, so as to do
away with the most repulsive difficulties of the subject;
but finding this popularization would be impossible, without
elaborate figures and long explanations, such as I had no
leisure to prepare, I have arranged the necessary rules in a
short mathematical form, which any schoolboy may read
through in a few days, after he has mastered the first three
and the sixth books of Euclid.,Some awkward compromises have been admitted between
the first-attempted popular explanation, and the severer
arrangement, involving irregular lettering and redundant
phraseology; but I cannot for the present do more, and leave
the book therefore to its trial, hoping that, if it be found by
masters of schools to answer its purpose, I may hereafter
bring it into better form.[Footnote 1]
 ,An account of practical methods, sufficient for general
purposes of sketching, might indeed have been set down in
[px]
 much less space: but if the student reads the following pages
carefully, he will not only find himself able, on occasion,
to solve perspective problems of a complexity greater than
the ordinary rules will reach, but obtain a clue to many
important laws of pictorial effect, no less than of outline.
The subject thus examined becomes, at least to my mind,
very curious and interesting; but, for students who are
unable or unwilling to take it up in this abstract form, I
believe good help will be soon furnished, in a series of illustrations
of practical perspective now in preparation by Mr. Le Vengeur. I have not seen this essay in an advanced
state, but the illustrations shown to me were very clear and
good; and, as the author has devoted much thought to their
arrangement, I hope that his work will be precisely what
is wanted by the general learner.,Students wishing to pursue the subject into its more
extended branches will find, I believe, Cloquet’s treatise the
best hitherto published.[Footnote 2]
 ,[Footnote 1:  Some irregularities of arrangement have been admitted merely for
the sake of convenient reference; the eighth problem, for instance,
ought to have been given as a case of the seventh, but is separately
enunciated on account of its importance.,Several constructions, which ought to have been given as problems,
are on the contrary given as corollaries, in order to keep the more
directly connected problems in closer sequence; thus the construction
of rectangles and polygons in vertical planes would appear by the Table
of Contents to have been omitted, being given in the corollary to Problem IX.]

 Return to text,INTRODUCTION.,When you begin to read this book, sit down very near
the window, and shut the window. I hope the view out of
it is pretty; but, whatever the view may be, we shall find
enough in it for an illustration of the first principles of
perspective (or, literally, of “looking through”).,Every pane of your window may be considered, if you
choose, as a glass picture; and what you see through it, as
painted on its surface.,And if, holding your head still, you extend your hand to
the glass, you may, with a brush full of any thick color, trace,
roughly, the lines of the landscape on the glass.,But, to do this, you must hold your head very still. Not
only you must not move it sideways, nor up and down, but
it must not even move backwards or forwards; for, if you
move your head forwards, you will see more of the landscape
through the pane; and, if you move it backwards, you will
see less: or considering the pane of glass as a picture, when
you hold your head near it, the objects are painted small,
and a great many of them go into a little space; but, when
you hold your head some distance back, the objects are
painted larger upon the pane, and fewer of them go into the
field of it.,But, besides holding your head still, you must, when you
try to trace the picture on the glass, shut one of your eyes.
If you do not, the point of the brush appears double; and,
[p2]
 on farther experiment, you will observe that each of your
eyes sees the object in a different place on the glass, so that
the tracing which is true to the sight of the right eye is a
couple of inches (or more, according to your distance from
the pane,) to the left of that which is true to the sight of
the left.,Thus, it is only possible to draw what you see through
the window rightly on the surface of the glass, by fixing one
eye at a given point, and neither moving it to the right nor
left, nor up nor down, nor backwards nor forwards. Every
picture drawn in true perspective may be considered as an
upright piece of glass,[Footnote 3]
  on which the objects seen through
it have been thus drawn. Perspective can, therefore, only be
quite right, by being calculated for one fixed position of the
eye of the observer; nor will it ever appear deceptively right
unless seen precisely from the point it is calculated for.
Custom, however, enables us to feel the rightness of the work
on using both our eyes, and to be satisfied with it, even
when we stand at some distance from the point it is
designed for.,Supposing that, instead of a window, an unbroken plate
of crystal extended itself to the right and left of you, and
high in front, and that you had a brush as long as you
wanted (a mile long, suppose), and could paint with such
a brush, then the clouds high up, nearly over your head,
and the landscape far away to the right and left, might be
traced, and painted, on this enormous crystal field.[Footnote 4]
  But
if the field were so vast (suppose a mile high and a mile
wide), certainly, after the picture was done, you would not
stand as near to it, to see it, as you are now sitting near to
your window. In order to trace the upper clouds through
your great glass, you would have had to stretch your neck
[p3]
 quite back, and nobody likes to bend their neck back to see
the top of a picture. So you would walk a long way back
to see the great picture—a quarter of a mile, perhaps,—and
then all the perspective would be wrong, and would
look quite distorted, and you would discover that you ought
to have painted it from the greater distance, if you meant
to look at it from that distance. Thus, the distance at which
you intend the observer to stand from a picture, and for
which you calculate the perspective, ought to regulate to
a certain degree the size of the picture. If you place the
point of observation near the canvas, you should not make
the picture very large: vice versâ, if you place the point of
observation far from the canvas, you should not make it
very small; the fixing, therefore, of this point of observation
determines, as a matter of convenience, within certain limits,
the size of your picture. But it does not determine this size
by any perspective law; and it is a mistake made by many
writers on perspective, to connect some of their rules definitely
with the size of the picture. For, suppose that you
had what you now see through your window painted actually
upon its surface, it would be quite optional to cut out any
piece you chose, with the piece of the landscape that was
painted on it. You might have only half a pane, with a single
tree; or a whole pane, with two trees and a cottage; or two
panes, with the whole farmyard and pond; or four panes,
with farmyard, pond, and foreground. And any of these
pieces, if the landscape upon them were, as a scene, pleasantly
composed, would be agreeable pictures, though of quite
different sizes; and yet they would be all calculated for the
same distance of observation.,In the following treatise, therefore, I keep the size of
the picture entirely undetermined. I consider the field of
canvas as wholly unlimited, and on that condition determine
the perspective laws. After we know how to apply those
laws without limitation, we shall see what limitations of the
size of the picture their results may render advisable.,But although the size of the picture is thus independent
[p4]
 of the observer’s distance, the size of the object represented in
the picture is not. On the contrary, that size is fixed by
absolute mathematical law; that is to say, supposing you have
to draw a tower a hundred feet high, and a quarter of a mile
distant from you, the height which you ought to give that
tower on your paper depends, with mathematical precision,
on the distance at which you intend your paper to be placed.
So, also, do all the rules for drawing the form of the tower,
whatever it may be.,Hence, the first thing to be done in beginning a drawing
is to fix, at your choice, this distance of observation, or the
distance at which you mean to stand from your paper. After
that is determined, all is determined, except only the ultimate
size of your picture, which you may make greater, or
less, not by altering the size of the things represented, but
by taking in more, or fewer of them. So, then, before proceeding
to apply any practical perspective rule, we must
always have our distance of observation marked, and the
most convenient way of marking it is the following:,PLACING OF THE SIGHT-POINT, SIGHT-LINE, STATION-POINT,
AND STATION-LINE.Fig. 1.,Let A B C D, Fig. 1., be your sheet
[p5]
 of paper, the larger the better, though perhaps we may cut
out of it at last only a small piece for our picture, such as the
dotted circle N O P Q. This circle is not intended to limit
either the size or shape of our picture: you may ultimately
have it round or oval, horizontal or upright, small or large,
as you choose. I only dot the line to give you an idea of
whereabouts you will probably like to have it; and, as the
operations of perspective are more conveniently performed
upon paper underneath the picture than above it, I put this
conjectural circle at the top of the paper, about the middle of
it, leaving plenty of paper on both sides and at the bottom.
Now, as an observer generally stands near the middle of a
picture to look at it, we had better at first, and for simplicity’s
sake, fix the point of observation opposite the middle of
our conjectural picture. So take the point S, the center
of the circle N O P Q;—or, which will be simpler for you in
your own work, take the point S at random near the top of
your paper, and strike the circle N O P Q round it, any size
you like. Then the point S is to represent the point opposite
which you wish the observer of your picture to place his eye,
in looking at it. Call this point the “Sight-Point.”, ,Through the Sight-point, S, draw
a horizontal line, G H, right across your paper from side to
side, and call this line the “Sight-Line.”, ,This line is of great practical use, representing the level
of the eye of the observer all through the picture. You will
find hereafter that if there is a horizon to be represented in
your picture, as of distant sea or plain, this line defines it.,From S let fall a perpendicular
line, S R, to the bottom of the paper, and call this line the
“Station-Line.”, ,This represents the line on which the observer stands, at a
greater or less distance from the picture; and it ought to be
imagined as drawn right out from the paper at the point S.
Hold your paper upright in front of you, and hold your pencil
horizontally, with its point against the point S, as if you
[p6]
 wanted to run it through the paper there, and the pencil will
represent the direction in which the line S R ought to be
drawn. But as all the measurements which we have to set
upon this line, and operations which we have to perform with
it, are just the same when it is drawn on the paper itself,
below S, as they would be if it were represented by a wire in
the position of the leveled pencil, and as they are much more
easily performed when it is drawn on the paper, it is always
in practice, so drawn.,On this line, mark the distance
S T at your pleasure, for the distance at which you wish
your picture to be seen, and call the point T the “Station-Point.”,Fig. 2.,In practice, it is generally advisable to make the distance
S T about as great as the diameter of your intended picture;
and it should, for the most part, be more rather than less;
but, as I have just stated, this is quite arbitrary. However,
in this figure, as an approximation to a generally advisable
distance, I make the distance S T equal to the diameter of the
circle N O P Q. Now, having fixed this distance, S T, all the
dimensions of the objects in our picture are fixed likewise,
and for this reason:—,Let the upright line A B, Fig. 2., represent a pane of glass
placed where our picture is to be placed; but seen at the side
[p7]
 of it, edgeways; let S be the Sight-point; S T the Station-line,
which, in this figure, observe, is in its true position, drawn
out from the paper, not down upon it; and T the Station-point.,Suppose the Station-line S T to be continued, or in mathematical
language “produced,” through S, far beyond the pane
of glass, and let P Q be a tower or other upright object situated
on or above this line.,Now the apparent height of the tower P Q is measured by
the angle Q T P, between the rays of light which come from
the top and bottom of it to the eye of the observer. But the
actual height of the image of the tower on the pane of glass
A B, between us and it, is the distance P′ Q′ between the
points where the rays traverse the glass.,Evidently, the farther from the point T we place the glass,
making S T longer, the larger will be the image; and the
nearer we place it to T, the smaller the image, and that in
a fixed ratio. Let the distance D T be the direct distance from
the Station-point to the foot of the object. Then, if we place
the glass A B at one-third of that whole distance, P′ Q′ will be
one-third of the real height of the object; if we place the
glass at two-thirds of the distance, as at E F, P″ Q″ (the
height of the image at that point) will be two-thirds the
height[Footnote 5]
  of the object, and so on. Therefore the mathematical
law is that P′ Q′ will be to P Q as S T to D T. I put
this ratio clearly by itself that you may remember it:,or in words:,In which formula, recollect that P′ Q′ is the height of the
appearance of the object on the picture; P Q the height of the
object itself; S the Sight-point; T the Station-point; D a point
at the direct distance of the object; though the object is
[p8]
 seldom placed actually on the line T S produced, and may be
far to the right or left of it, the formula is still the same.,For let S, Fig. 3., be the Sight-point, and A B the glass—here
seen looking down on its upper edge, not sideways;—then
if the tower (represented now, as on a map, by the dark
square), instead of being at D on the line S T produced, be at
E, to the right (or left) of the spectator,
still the apparent height of
the tower on A B will be as S′ T to
E T, which is the same ratio as that
of S T to D T.,Fig. 3.,Now in many perspective problems,
the position of an object is
more conveniently expressed by the
two measurements D T and D E, than
by the single oblique measurement
E T.,I shall call D T the “direct distance”
of the object at E, and D E
its “lateral distance.” It is rather
a license to call D T its “direct”
distance, for E T is the more direct
of the two; but there is no other term which would not cause
confusion.,Lastly, in order to complete our knowledge of the position
of an object, the vertical height of some point in it, above or
below the eye, must be given; that is to say, either D P or D Q
in Fig. 2.[Footnote 6]
 : this I shall call the “vertical distance” of the
point given. In all perspective problems these three distances,
and the dimensions of the object, must be stated,
otherwise the problem is imperfectly given. It ought not to
be required of us merely to draw a room or a church in perspective;
but to draw this room from this corner, and that
church on that spot, in perspective. For want of knowing
[p9]
 how to base their drawings on the measurement and place
of the object, I have known practiced students represent a
parish church, certainly in true perspective, but with a nave
about two miles and a half long.,It is true that in drawing landscapes from nature the sizes
and distances of the objects cannot be accurately known.
When, however, we know how to draw them rightly, if their
size were given, we have only to assume a rational approximation
to their size, and the resulting drawing will be true
enough for all intents and purposes. It does not in the least
matter that we represent a distant cottage as eighteen feet
long, when it is in reality only seventeen; but it matters much
that we do not represent it as eighty feet long, as we easily
might if we had not been accustomed to draw from measurement.
Therefore, in all the following problems the measurement
of the object is given.,The student must observe, however, that in order to bring
the diagrams into convenient compass, the measurements
assumed are generally very different from any likely to occur
in practice. Thus, in Fig. 3., the distance D S would be probably
in practice half a mile or a mile, and the distance T S,
from the eye of the observer to the paper, only two or three
feet. The mathematical law is however precisely the same,
whatever the proportions; and I use such proportions as are
best calculated to make the diagram clear.,Now, therefore, the conditions of a perspective problem
are the following:,The size of the picture, conjecturally limited by the dotted
circle, is to be determined afterwards at our pleasure. On
these conditions I proceed at once to construction.,[Footnote 3:  If the glass were not upright, but sloping, the objects might still
be drawn through it, but their perspective would then be different.
Perspective, as commonly taught, is always calculated for a vertical
plane of picture.]

top. In this figure both are above the sight-line; if the tower were
below the spectator both would be below it, and therefore measured
below D.]

object itself, or indicative of its distance.”]

D C; and vertical distance beneath the eye of the observer, C P.,[Let G H be the Sight-line, S the Sight-point, and T the
Station-point.][Footnote 9]
 ,It is required to fix on the plane of the picture the position
of the point P.,[p11]Arrange the three distances of the object on your paper,
as in Fig. 4.[Footnote 10]
 ,Join C T, cutting G H in Q.,From Q let fall the vertical line Q P′.,Join P T, cutting Q P in P′.,P′ is the point required.,If the point P is above the eye of the observer instead of
below it, C P is to be measured upwards from C, and Q P′
drawn upwards from Q. The construction will be as in Fig. 5.,Fig. 5.,And if the point P is to the right instead of the left of the
[p12]
 observer, D C is to be measured to the right instead of the
left.,The figures 4. and 5., looked at in a mirror, will show the
construction of each, on that supposition.,Now read very carefully the examples and notes to this
problem in Appendix I. (page 69). I have put them in the
Appendix in order to keep the sequence of following problems
more clearly traceable here in the text; but you must
read the first Appendix before going on.,[Footnote 8:  More accurately, “To fix on the plane of the picture the apparent
position of a point given in actual position.” In the headings of all
the following problems the words “on the plane of the picture” are to
be understood after the words “to draw.” The plane of the picture
means a surface extended indefinitely in the direction of the picture.]

small; as in the case of some object on the table: how large distances
are to be treated you will see presently; the mathematical principle,
being the same for all, is best illustrated first on a small scale. Suppose,
for instance, P to be the corner of a book on the table, seven
inches below the eye, five inches to the left of it, and a foot and a
half in advance of it, and that you mean to hold your finished drawing
at six inches from the eye; then T S will be six inches, T D a foot and
a half, D C five inches, and C P seven.]
 Return to text,Fig. 6.,Let A B, Fig. 6., be the given right line, joining the given
points A and B.,Let the direct, lateral, and vertical distances of the point
A be T D, D C, and C A.,Let the direct, lateral, and vertical distances of the point
B be T D′, D C′, and C′ B.,Then, by Problem I., the position of the point A on the
plane of the picture is a.,And similarly, the position of the point B on the plane of
the picture is b.,Join a b.,Then a b is the line required.,If the line A B is in a plane parallel to that of the picture,
one end of the line A B must be at the same direct distance
from the eye of the observer as the other.,Therefore, in that case, D T is equal to D′ T.,Then the construction will be as in Fig. 7.; and the student
will find experimentally that a b is now parallel to A B.[Footnote 11]
 ,Fig. 7.,And that a b is to A B as T S is to T D.,Therefore, to draw any line in a plane parallel to that of
the picture, we have only to fix the position of one of its
extremities, a or b, and then to draw from a or b a line parallel
to the given line, bearing the proportion to it that T S
bears to T D.,If the line A B is in a horizontal plane, the vertical distance
of one of its extremities must be the same as that of the other.,Therefore, in that case, A C equals B C′ (Fig. 6.).,And the construction is as in Fig. 8.,Fig. 8.,In Fig. 8. produce a b to the sight-line, cutting the sight-line
in V; the point V, thus determined, is called the Vanishing-Point
of the line A B.,Join T V. Then the student will find experimentally that
T V is parallel to A B.[Footnote 12]
 ,If the line A B produced would pass through some point
beneath or above the station-point, C D is to D T as C′ D′ is to
D′ T; in which case the point c coincides with the point c′,
and the line a b is vertical.,Therefore every vertical line in a picture is, or may be, the
perspective representation of a horizontal one which, produced,
would pass beneath the feet or above the head of the
spectator.[Footnote 13]
 ,[Footnote 11:  For by the construction
 A T ∶ a T ∷ B T ∶ b T;[eqn ii] and therefore the two
triangles A B T, a b T, (having a common angle A T B,) are similar.]

 Return to text,[Footnote 13:  The reflection in water of any luminous point or isolated object
(such as the sun or moon) is therefore, in perspective, a vertical line;
since such reflection, if produced, would pass under the feet of the
spectator. Many artists (Claude among the rest) knowing something
of optics, but nothing of perspective, have been led occasionally to draw
such reflections towards a point at the center of the base of the picture.]
 Return to text,Fig. 9.,Let A B, Fig. 9., be the given line.,From T, the station-point, draw T V parallel to A B, cutting
the sight-line in V.,V is the Vanishing-point required.[Footnote 14]
 ,As, if the point b is first found, V may be determined by
it, so, if the point V is first found, b may be determined by it.
For let A B, Fig. 10., be the given line, constructed upon the
paper as in Fig. 8.; and let it be required to draw the line
a b without using the point C′.,Fig. 10.,Find the position of the point A in a. (Problem I.),[p19]Find the vanishing-point of A B in V. (Problem III.),Join a V.,Join B T, cutting a V in b.,Then a b is the line required.[Footnote 15]
 ,We have hitherto proceeded on the supposition that the
given line was small enough, and near enough, to be actually
drawn on our paper of its real size; as in the example given
in Appendix I. We may, however, now deduce a construction
available under all circumstances, whatever may be the
distance and length of the line given.,Fig. 11.,From Fig. 8. remove, for the sake of clearness, the lines
[p20]
 C′ D′, b V, and T V; and, taking the figure as here in Fig. 11.,
draw from a, the line a R parallel to A B, cutting B T in R.,Then a R is to A B as a T is to A T.,Then — is to — as c T is to C T.,Then — is to — as T S is to T D.,That is to say, a R is the sight-magnitude of A B.[Footnote 16]
 ,Fig. 12.,Therefore, when the position of the point A is fixed in a,
as in Fig. 12., and a V is drawn to the vanishing-point; if we
draw a line a R from a, parallel to A B, and make a R equal
to the sight-magnitude of A B, and then join R T, the line R T
will cut a V in b.,So that, in order to determine the length of a b, we need
not draw the long and distant line A B, but only a R parallel
to it, and of its sight-magnitude; which is a great gain, for
the line A B may be two miles long, and the line a R perhaps
only two inches.,In Fig. 12., altering its proportions a little for the sake
of clearness, and putting it as here in Fig. 13., draw a horizontal
line a R′ and make a R′ equal to a R.,Through the points R and b draw R′ M, cutting the sight-line
in M. Join T V. Now the reader will find experimentally
that V M is equal to V T.[Footnote 17]
 ,Fig. 13.,Hence it follows that, if from the vanishing-point V we
lay off on the sight-line a distance, V M, equal to V T; then
draw through a a horizontal line a R′, make a R′ equal to the
sight-magnitude of A B, and join R′ M; the line R′ M will cut
a V in b. And this is in practice generally the most convenient
way of obtaining the length of a b.,Removing from the preceding figure the unnecessary lines,
and retaining only R′ M and a V, as in Fig. 14., produce the
line a R′ to the other side of a, and make a X equal to a R′.,Join X b, and produce X b to cut the line of sight in N.,Fig. 14.,Then as X R′ is parallel to M N, and a R′ is equal to a X,
V N must, by similar triangles, be equal to V M (equal to V T
in Fig. 13.).,Therefore, on whichever side of V we measure the distance
V T, so as to obtain either the point M, or the point N, if we
measure the sight-magnitude a R′ or a X on the opposite side
of the line a V, the line joining R′ M or X N will equally cut
a V in b.,The points M and N are called the “Dividing-Points” of
the original line A B (Fig. 12.), and we resume the results of
these corollaries in the following three problems.,[Footnote 14:  The student will observe, in practice, that, his paper lying flat
on the table, he has only to draw the line T V on its horizontal surface,
parallel to the given horizontal line A B. In theory, the paper should
be vertical, but the station-line S T horizontal (see its definition above,
page 5); in which case T V, being drawn parallel to A B, will be horizontal
also, and still cut the sight-line in V.,The construction will be seen to be founded on the second Corollary of
the preceding problem.,It is evident that if any other line, as M N in Fig. 9., parallel to A B,
occurs in the picture, the line T V, drawn from T, parallel to M N, to
find the vanishing-point of M N, will coincide with the line drawn from
T, parallel to A B, to find the vanishing-point of A B.,Therefore A B and M N will have the same vanishing-point.,Therefore all parallel horizontal lines have the same vanishing-point.,It will be shown hereafter that all parallel inclined lines also have
the same vanishing-point; the student may here accept the general
conclusion—“All parallel lines have the same vanishing-point.”,It is also evident that if A B is parallel to the plane of the picture, T V
must be drawn parallel to G H, and will therefore never cut G H. The
line A B has in that case no vanishing-point: it is to be drawn by the
construction given in Fig. 7.,It is also evident that if A B is at right angles with the plane of the
picture, T V will coincide with T S, and the vanishing-point of A B will
be the sight-point.]

 Return to text,Fig. 15.,Let the horizontal line A B (Fig. 15.) be given in position
and magnitude. It is required to find its dividing-points.,Find the vanishing-point V of the line A B.,With center V and distance V T, describe circle cutting the
sight-line in M and N.,Then M and N are the dividing-points required.,In general, only one dividing-point is needed for use with
any vanishing-point, namely, the one nearest S (in this case
the point M). But its opposite N, or both, may be needed
under certain circumstances.,Fig. 16.,Let A B (Fig. 16.) be the given line.,Find the position of the point A in a.,Find the vanishing-point V, and most convenient dividing-point
M, of the line A B.,Join a V.,Through a draw a horizontal line a b′ and make a b′ equal
to the sight-magnitude of A B. Join b′ M, cutting a V in b.,Then a b is the line required.,Fig. 17.,Supposing it were now required to draw a line A C (Fig. 17.) twice as long as A B, it is evident that the sight-magnitude
a c′ must be twice as long as the sight-magnitude a b′;
we have, therefore, merely to continue the horizontal line
a b′, make b′ c′ equal to a b′, join c M′, cutting a V in c, and
a c will be the line required. Similarly, if we have to draw
a line A D, three times the length of A B, a d′ must be three
times the length of a b′, and, joining d′ M, a d will be the line
required.,The student will observe that the nearer the portions cut
off, b c, c d, etc., approach the point V, the smaller they
become; and, whatever lengths may be added to the line A D,
and successively cut off from a V, the line a V will never be
cut off entirely, but the portions cut off will become infinitely
small, and apparently “vanish” as they approach the point
V; hence this point is called the “vanishing” point.,It is evident that if the line A D had been given originally,
and we had been required to draw it, and divide it into three
equal parts, we should have had only to divide its sight-magnitude,
a d′, into the three equal parts, a b′, b′ c′, and
c′ d′, and then, drawing to M from b′ and c′, the line a d would
have been divided as required in b and c. And supposing the
original line A D be divided irregularly into any number of
parts, if the line a d′ be divided into a similar number in the
same proportions (by the construction given in Appendix I.),
and, from these points of division, lines are drawn to M,
they will divide the line a d in true perspective into a similar
number of proportionate parts.,The horizontal line drawn through a, on which the sight-magnitudes
are measured, is called the “Measuring-line.”,And the line a d, when properly divided in b and c, or any
other required points, is said to be divided “IN PERSPECTIVE
RATIO” to the divisions of the original line A D.,If the line a V is above the sight-line instead of beneath it,
the measuring-line is to be drawn above also: and the lines
b′ M, c′ M, etc., drawn down to the dividing-point. Turn Fig. 17. upside down, and it will show the construction.,Fig. 18.,Let A B C (Fig. 18.) be the triangle.,As it is given in position and magnitude, one of its sides,
at least, must be given in position and magnitude, and the
directions of the two other sides.,Let A B be the side given in position and magnitude.,Then A B is a horizontal line, in a given position, and of
a given length.,Draw the line A B. (Problem V.),Let a b be the line so drawn.,Find V and V′, the vanishing-points respectively of the
lines A C and B C. (Problem III.),[p28]From a draw a V, and from b, draw b V′, cutting each
other in c.,Then a b c is the triangle required.,If A C is the line originally given, a c is the line which must
be first drawn, and the line V′ b must be drawn from V′ to c
and produced to cut a b in b. Similarly, if B C is given, V c
must be drawn to c and produced, and a b from its vanishing-point
to b, and produced to cut a c in a.,Fig. 19.,Let A B C D (Fig. 19.) be the given figure.,Join any two of its opposite angles by the line B C.,Draw first the triangle A B C. (Problem VI.),And then, from the base B C, the two lines B D, C D, to their
vanishing-points, which will complete the figure. It is unnecessary
to give a diagram of the construction, which is
merely that of Fig. 18. duplicated; another triangle being
drawn on the line A C or B C.,It is evident that by this application of Problem VI. any
given rectilinear figure whatever in a horizontal plane may
be drawn, since any such figure may be divided into a number
of triangles, and the triangles then drawn in succession.,More convenient methods may, however, be generally
[p30]
 found, according to the form of the figure required, by the
use of succeeding problems; and for the quadrilateral figure
which occurs most frequently in practice, namely, the square,
the following construction is more convenient than that used
in the present problem.,Fig. 20.,Let A B C D, Fig. 20., be the square.,As it is given in position and magnitude, the position and
magnitude of all its sides are given.,Fix the position of the point A in a.,Find V, the vanishing-point of A B; and M, the dividing-point
of A B, nearest S.,Find V′, the vanishing-point of A C; and N, the dividing-point
of A C, nearest S.,[p32]Draw the measuring-line through a, and make a b′, a c′,
each equal to the sight-magnitude of A B.,(For since A B C D is a square, A C is equal to A B.),Draw a V′ and c′ N, cutting each other in c.,Draw a V, and b′ M, cutting each other in b.,Then a c, a b, are the two nearest sides of the square.,Now, clearing the figure of superfluous lines, we have
a b, a c, drawn in position, as in Fig. 21.,Fig. 21.,And because A B C D is a square, C D (Fig. 20.) is parallel
to A B.,And all parallel lines have the same vanishing-point.
(Note to Problem III.),Therefore, V is the vanishing-point of C D.,Similarly, V′ is the vanishing-point of B D.,Therefore, from b and c (Fig. 22.) draw b V′, c V, cutting
each other in d.,Then a b c d is the square required.,It is obvious that any rectangle in a horizontal plane may
be drawn by this problem, merely making a b′, on the measuring-line,
Fig. 20., equal to the sight-magnitude of one of its
sides, and a c′ the sight-magnitude of the other.,Let a b c d, Fig. 22., be any square drawn in perspective.
Draw the diagonals a d and b c, cutting each other in C.
Then C is the center of the square. Through C, draw e f to
the vanishing-point of a b, and g h to the vanishing-point of
a c, and these lines will bisect the sides of the square, so that
a g is the perspective representation of half the side a b; a e
is half a c; c h is half c d; and b f is half b d.,Fig. 22.,Since A B C D, Fig. 20., is a square, B A C is a right angle;
and as T V is parallel to A B, and T V′ to A C, V′ T V must be a
right angle also.,As the ground plan of most buildings is rectangular, it
constantly happens in practice that their angles (as the corners
of ordinary houses) throw the lines to the vanishing-points
thus at right angles; and so that this law is observed,
and V T V′ is kept a right angle, it does not matter in general
practice whether the vanishing-points are thrown a little
more or a little less to the right or left of S: but it matters
much that the relation of the vanishing-points should be
accurate. Their position with respect to S merely causes the
spectator to see a little more or less on one side or other of
the house, which may be a matter of chance or choice; but
their rectangular relation determines the rectangular shape
of the building, which is an essential point.,Let A H, Fig. 23., be the square pillar.,Then, as it is given in position and magnitude, the position
and magnitude of the square it stands upon must be given
(that is, the line A B or A C in
position), and the height of its
side A E.,Fig. 23.Fig. 24.,Find the sight-magnitudes of
A B and A E. Draw the two sides
a b, a c, of the square of the base,
by Problem VIII., as in Fig. 24.
From the points a, b, and c, raise
vertical lines a e, c f, b g.,Make a e equal to the sight-magnitude
of A E.,Now because the top and base of the pillar are in horizontal
planes, the square of its top, F G, is parallel to the
square of its base, B C.,Therefore the line E F is parallel to A C, and E G to A B.,Therefore E F has the same vanishing-point as A C, and E G
the same vanishing-point as A B.,From e draw e f to the vanishing-point of a c, cutting c f
in f.,Similarly draw e g to the vanishing-point of a b, cutting
b g in g.,Complete the square g f in h, by drawing g h to the vanishing-point
of e f, and f h to the vanishing-point of e g, cutting
each other in h. Then a g h f is the square pillar required.,It is obvious that if A E is equal to A C, the whole figure
will be a cube, and each side, a e f c and a e g b, will be a
square in a given vertical plane. And by making A B or
A C longer or shorter in any given proportion, any form of
rectangle may be given to either of the sides of the pillar.
No other rule is therefore needed for drawing squares or
rectangles in vertical planes.,Also any triangle may be thus drawn in a vertical plane,
by inclosing it in a rectangle and determining, in perspective
ratio, on the sides of the rectangle, the points of their contact
with the angles of the triangle.,And if any triangle, then any polygon.,A less complicated construction will, however, be given
hereafter.[Footnote 18]

of the pyramid, and make the height of the pillar A F equal

Draw the diagonals G F, H I, on the top of the square pillar,
cutting each other in C. Therefore C is the center of the
square F G H I. (Prob. VIII. Cor. II.),Fig. 27.,Join C E, C A, C B.,Then A B C E is the pyramid required. If the base of the
pyramid is above the eye, as when a square spire is seen on
the top of a church-tower, the construction will be as in
Fig. 27.,[Footnote 19:  If, instead of the vertical height, the length of A D is given, the
vertical must be deduced from it. See the Exercises on this Problem

 ,Let C D E F, Fig. 29., be the rectangle so drawn.,Fig. 29.,If an extremity of the curve, as A, is in a side of the rectangle,
divide the side C E, Fig. 29.,
so that A C shall be (in perspective
ratio) to A E as A C is to A E in Fig. 28. (Prob. V. Cor. II.),Similarly determine the points of
contact of the curve and rectangle
e, f, g.,If an extremity of the curve, as B,
is not in a side of the rectangle, let
[p39]
 fall the perpendiculars B a, B b on the rectangle sides. Determine
the correspondent points a and b in Fig. 29., as you have
already determined A, B, e, and f.,From b, Fig. 29., draw b B parallel to C D,[Footnote 21]
  and from a
draw a B to the vanishing-point of D F, cutting each other in
B. Then B is the extremity of the curve.,Determine any other important point in the curve, as P, in
the same way, by letting fall P q and P r on the rectangle’s
sides.,Any number of points in the curve may be thus determined,
and the curve drawn through the series; in most
cases, three or four will be enough. Practically, complicated
curves may be better drawn in perspective by an experienced
eye than by rule, as the fixing of the various points
in haste involves too many chances of error; but it is well to
draw a good many by rule first, in order to give the eye its
experience.[Footnote 22]
 ,If the curve required be a circle, Fig. 30., the rectangle
which incloses it will become a square,
and the curve will have four points of
contact, A B C D, in the middle of the
sides of the square.,Fig. 30.,Draw the square, and as a square
may be drawn about a circle in any
position, draw it with its nearest side,
E G, parallel to the sight-line.,Let E F, Fig. 31., be the square so
drawn.,[p40]Draw its diagonals E F, G H; and through the center of the
square (determined by their intersection) draw A B to the
vanishing-point of G F, and C D parallel to E G. Then the
points A B C D are the four points of the circle’s contact.,Fig. 31.,On E G describe a half square, E L; draw the semicircle
K A L; and from its center, R, the diagonals R E, R G, cutting
the circle in x, y.,From the points x y, where the circle cuts the diagonals,
raise perpendiculars, P x, Q y, to E G.,From P and Q draw P P′, Q Q′, to the vanishing-point of
G F, cutting the diagonals in m, n, and o, p.,Then m, n, o, p are four other points in the circle.,Through these eight points the circle may be drawn by the
hand accurately enough for general purposes; but any number
of points required may, of course, be determined, as in
Problem XI.,The distance E P is approximately one-seventh of E G, and
may be assumed to be so in quick practice, as the error involved
is not greater than would be incurred in the hasty
operation of drawing the circle and diagonals.,It may frequently happen that, in consequence of associated
[p41]
 constructions, it may be inconvenient to draw E G parallel
to the sight-line, the square being perhaps first constructed
in some oblique direction. In such cases, Q G and
E P must be determined in perspective ratio by the dividing-point,
the line E G being used as a measuring-line.,[Obs. In drawing Fig. 31. the station-point has been taken much
nearer the paper than is usually advisable, in order to show the character
of the curve in a very distinct form.,If the student turns the book so that E G may be vertical, Fig. 31.
will represent the construction for drawing a circle in a vertical plane,
the sight-line being then of course parallel to G L; and the semicircles
A D B, A C B, on each side of the diameter A B, will represent ordinary
semicircular arches seen in perspective. In that case, if the book be
held so that the line E H is the top of the square, the upper semicircle
will represent a semicircular arch, above the eye, drawn in perspective.
But if the book be held so that the line G F is the top of the square, the
upper semicircle will represent a semicircular arch, below the eye,
drawn in perspective.,If the book be turned upside down, the figure will represent a circle
drawn on the ceiling, or any other horizontal plane above the eye;
and the construction is, of course, accurate in every case.],[Footnote 20:  Or if the curve is in a vertical plane, Coroll. to Problem IX. As
a rectangle may be drawn in any position round any given curve, its
position with respect to the curve will in either case be regulated by
convenience. See the Exercises on this Problem, in the Appendix, p. 85.]

 Return to text,Let A B, Fig. 32., be the circle drawn in perspective. It
is required to divide it into a given number of equal parts;
in this case, 20.,Let K A L be the semicircle used in the construction.
Divide the semicircle K A L into half the number of parts
required; in this case, 10.,Produce the line E G laterally, as far as may be necessary.,From O, the center of the semicircle K A L, draw radii
through the points of division of the semicircle, p, q, r, etc.,
and produce them to cut the line E G in P, Q, R, etc.,From the points P Q R draw the lines P P′, Q Q′, R R′, etc.,
through the center of the circle A B, each cutting the circle
in two points of its circumference.,Then these points divide the perspective circle as required.,If from each of the points p, q, r, a vertical were raised to
the line E G, as in Fig. 31., and from the point where it cut
E G a line were drawn to the vanishing-point, as Q Q′ in Fig. 31., this line would also determine two of the points of
division.,[p43]
 Fig. 32.,If it is required to divide a circle into any number of
given unequal parts (as in the points A, B, and C, Fig. 33.),
the shortest way is thus to raise vertical lines from A and B
to the side of the perspective square X Y, and then draw to
the vanishing-point, cutting the perspective circle in a and b,
the points required. Only notice that if any point, as A, is
on the nearer side of the circle A B C, its representative point,
a, must be on the nearer side of the circle a b c; and if the
point B is on the farther side of the circle A B C, b must be
[p44]
 on the farther side of a b c. If any point, as C, is so much
in the lateral arc of the circle as not to be easily determinable
by the vertical line, draw the horizontal C P, find the correspondent
p in the side of the perspective square, and draw
p c parallel to X Y, cutting the perspective circle in c.,Fig. 33.,It is obvious that if the points P′, Q′, R, etc., by which the
circle is divided in Fig. 32., be joined by right lines, the resulting
figure will be a regular equilateral figure of twenty
sides inscribed in the circle. And if the circle be divided
into given unequal parts, and the points of division joined
by right lines, the resulting figure will be an irregular polygon
inscribed in the circle with sides of given length.,Thus any polygon, regular or irregular, inscribed in a circle,
may be inscribed in position in a perspective circle.,Fig. 34.,Let A B, Fig. 34., be the sight-magnitude of the side of
the smaller square, and A C that of the side of the larger
square.,Draw the larger square. Let D E F G be the square so
drawn.,Join E G and D F.,On either D E or D G set off, in perspective ratio, D H equal
to one half of B C. Through H draw H K to the vanishing-point
of D E, cutting D F in I and E G in K. Through I and
K draw I M, K L, to vanishing-point of D G, cutting D F in L
and E G in M. Join L M.,Then I K L M is the smaller square, inscribed as required.[Footnote 23]

 Return to text,We have hitherto been examining the conditions of horizontal
and vertical lines only, or of curves inclosed in rectangles.,Fig. 39.
Fig. 40.,We must, in conclusion, investigate the perspective of inclined
lines, beginning with a single one given in position.
For the sake of completeness of system, I give in Appendix II. Article III. the development of this problem from the
second. But, in practice, the position of an inclined line
may be most conveniently defined by considering it as the
diagonal of a rectangle, as A B in Fig. 39., and I shall therefore,
though at some sacrifice of system, examine it here
under that condition.,If the sides of the rectangle A C and A D are given, the
slope of the line A B is determined; and then its position will
depend on that of the rectangle. If, as in Fig. 39., the rectangle
is parallel to the picture plane, the line A B must be
so also. If, as in Fig. 40., the rectangle is inclined to the
[p51]
 picture plane, the line A B will be so also. So that, to fix
the position of A B, the line A C must be given in position and
magnitude, and the height A D.,Fig. 41.,If these are given, and it is only required to draw the
single line A B in perspective, the construction is entirely
simple; thus:—,Draw the line A C by Problem I.,Let A C, Fig. 41., be the line so drawn. From
a and c raise the vertical lines a d, c b. Make a d
equal to the sight-magnitude of A D. From d draw
d b to the vanishing-point of a c, cutting b c in b.,Join a b. Then a b is the inclined line required.,Fig. 42.,If the line is inclined in the opposite direction,
as D C in Fig. 42., we have only to join d c instead of a b in
Fig. 41., and d c will be the line required.,I shall hereafter call the line A C, when used
to define the position of an inclined line A B
(Fig. 40.), the “relative horizontal” of the
line A B.,Fig. 43.,In general, inclined lines are most needed for gable roofs,
in which, when the conditions are properly stated, the vertical
height of the gable, X Y, Fig. 43., is given, and the base line,
A C, in position. When these are
given, draw A C; raise vertical
A D; make A D equal to sight-magnitude
of X Y; complete the
perspective-rectangle A D B C; join
A B and D C (as by dotted lines in
figure); and through the intersection
of the dotted lines draw vertical X Y, cutting D B in Y.
Join A Y, C Y; and these lines are the sides of the gable. If
[p52]
 the length of the roof A A′ is also given, draw in perspective
the complete parallelopiped A′ D′ B C, and from Y draw Y Y′
to the vanishing-point of A A′, cutting D′ B′ in Y′. Join A′ Y,
and you have the slope of the farther side of the roof.,Fig. 44.,The construction above the eye is as in Fig. 44.; the roof
is reversed in direction merely to familiarize the student with
the different aspects of its lines.,If, in Fig. 43. or Fig. 44., the lines A Y and A′ Y′ be produced,
the student will find that they meet.,Let P, Fig. 45., be the point at which they meet.,From P let fall the vertical P V on the sight-line, cutting
the sight-line in V.,Then the student will find experimentally that V is the
vanishing-point of the line A C.[Footnote 26]
 ,Complete the rectangle of the base A C′, by drawing A′ C′

will find that they meet.,Let them be produced, and meet in P′.,Produce P V, and it will be found to pass through the
point P′.,Therefore if A Y (or C Y), Fig. 45., be any inclined line
drawn in perspective by Problem XV., and A C the relative
horizontal (A C in Figs. 39, 40.), also drawn in perspective.,Through V, the vanishing-point of A V, draw the vertical
P P′ upwards and downwards.,Produce A Y (or C Y), cutting P P′ in P (or P′).,Then P is the vanishing-point of A Y (or P′ of C Y).,Fig. 45.,The student will observe that, in order to find the point P
by this method, it is necessary first to draw a portion of the
given inclined line by Problem XV. Practically, it is always
necessary to do so, and, therefore, I give the problem
in this form.,[p54]Theoretically, as will be shown in the analysis of the problem,
the point P should be found by drawing a line from the
station-point parallel to the given inclined line: but there is
no practical means of drawing such a line; so that in whatever
terms the problem may be given, a portion of the inclined
line (A Y or C Y) must always be drawn in perspective
before P can be found.,[Footnote 26:  
The demonstration is in Appendix II. Article III.]

 ,Obs. The dividing-points found by the above rule, used
with the ordinary measuring-line, will lay off distances on
the retiring inclined line, as the ordinary dividing-points lay
them off on the retiring horizontal line.,Another dividing-point, peculiar in its application, is
sometimes useful, and is to be found as follows:—,[p56]

and A c the relative horizontal.,Find the vanishing-points, V and E, of A c and A B; D, the

measuring-line, or A C.,From D erect the perpendicular D F.,Join C B, and produce it to cut D E in F. Join E F.,Then, by similar triangles, D F is equal to E V, and E F is
parallel to D V.,Hence it follows that if from D, the dividing-point of A c,
we raise a perpendicular and make D F equal to E V, a line
C F, drawn from any point C on the measuring-line to F, will
mark the distance A B on the inclined line, A B being the portion
of the given inclined line which forms the diagonal of
the vertical rectangle of which A C is the base.,[Footnote 27:  
The demonstration is in Appendix II., p. 104.]
 Return to text,As in order to fix the position of a line two points in it

and may be produced in either direction as occasion requires,
crossing the horizontal line of sight, if the plane continues
downward in that direction.,X is the vanishing-point of all horizontal lines in the
inclined plane.,[Footnote 28:  
Read the Article on this problem in the Appendix, p. 97, before
investigating the problem itself.]
 Return to text,Fig. 49.,Let V X, Fig. 49., be the given sight-line.,Produce it to cut the horizontal sight-line in X.,Therefore X is the vanishing-point of horizontal lines in

to X.[Footnote 29]
 ,From Y erect the vertical Y P, cutting the sight-line of the

possible in the plane; and all lines drawn to X, as Q X, O X,
etc., are horizontal, and at right angles to the lines P Q, P R,
etc.,[Footnote 29:  That is to say, the vanishing-point of horizontal lines drawn at
right angles to the lines whose vanishing-point is X.]
 Return to text,Fig. 50.,As the inclined plane is given, one of its steepest lines
must be given, or may be ascertained.,Let A B, Fig. 50., be a portion of a steepest line in the
[p62]
 given plane, and V the vanishing-point of its relative horizontal.,Through V draw the vertical G F upwards and downwards.,From A set off any portion of the relative horizontal A C,
and on A C describe a semicircle in a vertical plane, A D C,
cutting A B in E.,Join E C, and produce it to cut G F in F.,Then F is the vanishing-point required.,For, because A E C is an angle in a semicircle, it is a right
angle; and therefore the line E F is at right angles to the line
A B; and similarly all lines drawn to F, and therefore parallel
to E F, are at right angles with any line which cuts them,
drawn to the vanishing-point of A B.,And because the semicircle A D C is in a vertical plane, and
its diameter A C is at right angles to the horizontal lines traversing
the surface of the inclined plane, the line E C, being
in this semicircle, is also at right angles to such traversing
lines. And therefore the line E C, being at right angles to
the steepest lines in the plane, and to the horizontal lines in
it, is perpendicular to its surface.,[p63]The preceding series of constructions, with the examples
in the first Article of the Appendix, put it in the power of
the student to draw any form, however complicated,[Footnote 30]
  which
does not involve intersection of curved surfaces. I shall not
proceed to the analysis of any of these more complex problems,
as they are entirely useless in the ordinary practice of
artists. For a few words only I must ask the reader’s
further patience, respecting the general placing and scale of
the picture.,As the horizontal sight-line is drawn through the sight-point,
and the sight-point is opposite the eye, the sight-line
is always on a level with the eye. Above and below the sight-line,
the eye comprehends, as it is raised or depressed while
the head is held upright, about an equal space; and, on each
side of the sight-point, about the same space is easily seen
without turning the head; so that if a picture represented
the true field of easy vision, it ought to be circular, and have
the sight-point in its center. But because some parts of any
given view are usually more interesting than others, either
the uninteresting parts are left out, or somewhat more than
would generally be seen of the interesting parts is included,
by moving the field of the picture a little upwards or downwards,
so as to throw the sight-point low or high. The operation
will be understood in a moment by cutting an aperture
in a piece of pasteboard, and moving it up and down in front
of the eye, without moving the eye. It will be seen to embrace
sometimes the low, sometimes the high objects, without
[p64]
 altering their perspective, only the eye will be opposite the
lower part of the aperture when it sees the higher objects,
and vice versâ.,There is no reason, in the laws of perspective, why the
picture should not be moved to the right or left of the sight-point,
as well as up or down. But there is this practical
reason. The moment the spectator sees the horizon in a picture
high, he tries to hold his head high, that is, in its right
place. When he sees the horizon in a picture low, he similarly
tries to put his head low. But, if the sight-point is
thrown to the left hand or right hand, he does not understand
that he is to step a little to the right or left; and if he places
himself, as usual, in the middle, all the perspective is distorted.
Hence it is generally unadvisable to remove the
sight-point laterally, from the center of the picture. The
Dutch painters, however, fearlessly take the license of
placing it to the right or left; and often with good effect.,The rectilinear limitation of the sides, top, and base of
the picture is of course quite arbitrary, as the space of a landscape
would be which was seen through a window; less or
more being seen at the spectator’s pleasure, as he retires or
advances.,The distance of the station-point is not so arbitrary. In
ordinary cases it should not be less than the intended greatest
dimension (height or breadth) of the picture. In most
works by the great masters it is more; they not only calculate
on their pictures being seen at considerable distances,
but they like breadth of mass in buildings, and dislike the
sharp angles which always result from station-points at short
distances.[Footnote 31]
 ,Whenever perspective, done by true rule, looks wrong, it
is always because the station-point is too near. Determine,
[p65]
 in the outset, at what distance the spectator is likely to examine
the work, and never use a station-point within a less
distance.,There is yet another and a very important reason, not only
for care in placing the station-point, but for that accurate
calculation of distance and observance of measurement which
have been insisted on throughout this work. All drawings
of objects on a reduced scale are, if rightly executed, drawings
of the appearance of the object at the distance which in
true perspective reduces it to that scale. They are not small
drawings of the object seen near, but drawings the real size
of the object seen far off. Thus if you draw a mountain in
a landscape, three inches high, you do not reduce all the features
of the near mountain so as to come into three inches of
paper. You could not do that. All that you can do is to
give the appearance of the mountain, when it is so far off
that three inches of paper would really hide it from you.
It is precisely the same in drawing any other object. A face
can no more be reduced in scale than a mountain can. It is
infinitely delicate already; it can only be quite rightly rendered
on its own scale, or at least on the slightly diminished
scale which would be fixed by placing the plate of glass, supposed
to represent the field of the picture, close to the
figures. Correggio and Raphael were both fond of this
slightly subdued magnitude of figure. Colossal painting, in
which Correggio excelled all others, is usually the enlargement
of a small picture (as a colossal sculpture is of a small
statue), in order to permit the subject of it to be discerned at
a distance. The treatment of colossal (as distinguished from
ordinary) paintings will depend therefore, in general, on
the principles of optics more than on those of perspective,
though, occasionally, portions may be represented as if they
were the projection of near objects on a plane behind them.
In all points the subject is one of great difficulty and subtlety;
and its examination does not fall within the compass
of this essay.,Lastly, it will follow from these considerations, and the
[p66]
 conclusion is one of great practical importance, that, though
pictures may be enlarged, they cannot be reduced, in copying
them. All attempts to engrave pictures completely on a reduced
scale are, for this reason, nugatory. The best that can
be done is to give the aspect of the picture at the distance
which reduces it in perspective to the size required; or, in
other words, to make a drawing of the distant effect of the
picture. Good painting, like nature’s own work, is infinite,
and unreduceable.,I wish this book had less tendency towards the infinite and
unreduceable. It has so far exceeded the limits I hoped to
give it, that I doubt not the reader will pardon an abruptness
of conclusion, and be thankful, as I am myself, to get to an
end on any terms.,[Footnote 30:  As in algebraic science, much depends, in complicated perspective,
on the student’s ready invention of expedients, and on his quick
sight of the shortest way in which the solution may be accomplished,
when there are several ways.]
 Return to text,[Footnote 31:  The greatest masters are also fond of parallel perspective, that is
to say, of having one side of their buildings fronting them full, and
therefore parallel to the picture plane, while the other side vanishes
to the sight-point. This is almost always done in figure backgrounds,
securing simple and balanced lines.]
 Return to text,I.PRACTICE AND OBSERVATIONS.II.DEMONSTRATIONS.,An example will be necessary to make this problem clear
to the general student.,The nearest corner of a piece of pattern on the carpet is
4½ feet beneath the eye, 2 feet to our right and 3½ feet in
direct distance from us. We intend to make a drawing of
the pattern which shall be seen properly when held 1½ foot
from the eye. It is required to fix the position of the corner
of the piece of pattern.,Fig. 51.,Let A B, Fig. 51., be our sheet of
paper, some 3 feet wide. Make S T
equal to 1½ foot. Draw the line of
sight through S. Produce T S, and
make D S equal to 2 feet, therefore T D
equal to 3½ feet. Draw D C, equal to
2 feet; C P, equal to 4 feet. Join
T C (cutting the sight-line in Q)
and T P.,Let fall the vertical Q P′, then P′
is the point required.,If the lines, as in the figure, fall
outside of your sheet of paper, in
order to draw them, it is necessary to attach other sheets of
paper to its edges. This is inconvenient, but must be done
[p70]
 at first that you may see your way clearly; and sometimes
afterwards, though there are expedients for doing without
such extension in fast sketching.,It is evident, however, that no extension of surface could
be of any use to us, if the distance T D, instead of being 3½
feet, were 100 feet, or a mile, as it might easily be in a
landscape.,It is necessary, therefore, to obtain some other means of
construction; to do which we must examine the principle of
the problem.,In the analysis of Fig. 2., in the introductory remarks, I
used the word “height” only of the tower, Q P, because it
was only to its vertical height that the law deduced from the
figure could be applied. For suppose it had been a pyramid,
as O Q P, Fig. 52., then the image of its side, Q P, being,
like every other magnitude, limited on the glass A B by the
lines coming from its extremities, would appear only of the
length Q′ S; and it is not true that Q′ S is to Q P as T S is to
T P. But if we let fall a vertical Q D from Q, so as to get
the vertical height of the pyramid, then it is true that Q′ S is
to Q D as T S is to T D.,Fig. 52.,Supposing this figure represented, not a pyramid, but a
triangle on the ground, and that Q D and Q P are horizontal
lines, expressing lateral distance from the line T D, still the
rule would be false for Q P and true for Q D. And, similarly,
it is true for all lines which are parallel, like Q D, to
[p71]
 the plane of the picture A B, and false for all lines which are
inclined to it at an angle.,Hence generally. Let P Q (Fig. 2. in Introduction, p. 6)
be any magnitude parallel to the plane of the picture; and
P′ Q′ its image on the picture.,Then always the formula is true which you learned in
the Introduction: P′ Q′ is to P Q as S T is to D T.,Now the magnitude P dash Q dash in this formula I call
the “SIGHT-MAGNITUDE” of the line P Q. The student must
fix this term, and the meaning of it, well in his mind. The
“sight-magnitude” of a line is the magnitude which bears
to the real line the same proportion that the distance of the
picture bears to the distance of the object. Thus, if a tower
be a hundred feet high, and a hundred yards off; and the
picture, or piece of glass, is one yard from the spectator, between
him and the tower; the distance of picture being then
to distance of tower as 1 to 100, the sight-magnitude of the
tower’s height will be as 1 to 100; that is to say, one foot.
If the tower is two hundred yards distant, the sight-magnitude
of its height will be half a foot, and so on.,But farther. It is constantly necessary, in perspective
operations, to measure the other dimensions of objects by
the sight-magnitude of their vertical lines. Thus, if the
tower, which is a hundred feet high, is square, and twenty-five
feet broad on each side; if the sight-magnitude of the
height is one foot, the measurement of the side, reduced to
the same scale, will be the hundredth part of twenty-five feet,
or three inches: and, accordingly, I use in this treatise the
term “sight-magnitude” indiscriminately for all lines reduced
in the same proportion as the vertical lines of the object.
If I tell you to find the “sight-magnitude” of any
line, I mean, always, find the magnitude which bears to that
line the proportion of S T to D T; or, in simpler terms, reduce
the line to the scale which you have fixed by the first
determination of the length S T.,Therefore, you must learn to draw quickly to scale before
you do anything else; for all the measurements of your object
[p72]
 must be reduced to the scale fixed by S T before you can
use them in your diagram. If the object is fifty feet from
you, and your paper one foot, all the lines of the object must
be reduced to a scale of one fiftieth before you can use them;
if the object is two thousand feet from you, and your paper
one foot, all your lines must be reduced to the scale of one
two-thousandth before you can use them, and so on. Only
in ultimate practice, the reduction never need be tiresome,
for, in the case of large distances, accuracy is never required.
If a building is three or four miles distant, a hairbreadth of
accidental variation in a touch makes a difference of ten or
twenty feet in height or breadth, if estimated by accurate
perspective law. Hence it is never attempted to apply
measurements with precision at such distances. Measurements
are only required within distances of, at the most, two
or three hundred feet. Thus it may be necessary to represent
a cathedral nave precisely as seen from a spot seventy
feet in front of a given pillar; but we shall hardly be required
to draw a cathedral three miles distant precisely as seen from
seventy feet in advance of a given milestone. Of course, if
such a thing be required, it can be done; only the reductions
are somewhat long and complicated: in ordinary cases it is
easy to assume the distance S T so as to get at the reduced
dimensions in a moment. Thus, let the pillar of the nave,
in the case supposed, be 42 feet high, and we are required
to stand 70 feet from it: assume S T to be equal to 5 feet.
Then, as 5 is to 70 so will the sight-magnitude required be
to 42; that is to say, the sight-magnitude of the pillar’s
height will be 3 feet. If we make S T equal to 2½ feet, the
pillar’s height will be 1½ foot, and so on.,And for fine divisions into irregular parts which cannot
be measured, the ninth and tenth problems of the sixth book
of Euclid will serve you: the following construction is,
however, I think, more practically convenient:—,The line A B (Fig. 53.) is divided by given points, a, b, c,
into a given number of irregularly unequal parts; it is required
to divide any other line, C D, into an equal number
[p73]
 of parts, bearing to each other the same proportions as the
parts of A B, and arranged in the same order.,Draw the two lines parallel to each other, as in the figure.,Join A C and B D, and produce the lines A C, B D, till they
meet in P.,Join a P, b P, c P, cutting c D in f, g, h.,Then the line C D is divided as required, in f, g, h.,In the figure the lines A B and C D are accidentally perpendicular
to A P. There is no need for their being so.,Fig. 53.,Now, to return to our first problem.,The construction given in the figure is only the quickest
mathematical way of obtaining, on the picture, the sight-magnitudes
of D C and P C, which are both magnitudes parallel
with the picture plane. But if these magnitudes are
too great to be thus put on the paper, you have only to obtain
the reduction by scale. Thus, if T S be one foot, T D
eighty feet, D C forty feet, and C P ninety feet, the distance
Q S must be made equal to one eightieth of D C, or half a
foot; and the distance Q P′, one eightieth of C P, or one eightieth
of ninety feet; that is to say, nine eighths of a foot, or
thirteen and a half inches. The lines C T and P T are thus
practically useless, it being only necessary to measure Q S
[p74]
 and Q P, on your paper, of the due sight-magnitudes. But
the mathematical construction, given in Problem I., is the
basis of all succeeding problems, and, if it is once thoroughly
understood and practiced (it can only be thoroughly understood
by practice), all the other problems will follow easily.,Lastly. Observe that any perspective operation whatever
may be performed with reduced dimensions of every line employed,
so as to bring it conveniently within the limits of
your paper. When the required figure is thus constructed
on a small scale, you have only to enlarge it accurately
in the same proportion in which you reduced the lines of
construction, and you will have the figure constructed in
perspective on the scale required for use.,The drawing of most buildings occurring in ordinary
practice will resolve itself into applications of this problem.
In general, any house, or block of houses, presents itself
under the main conditions assumed here in Fig. 54. There
will be an angle or corner somewhere near the spectator, as
A B; and the level of the eye will usually be above the base
of the building, of which, therefore, the horizontal upper
lines will slope down to the vanishing-points, and the base
lines rise to them. The following practical directions will,
however, meet nearly all cases:—,Fig. 54.,Let A B, Fig. 54., be any important vertical line in the
block of buildings; if it is the side of a street, you may fix
upon such a line at the division between two houses. If its
real height, distance, etc., are given, you will proceed with
[p76]
 the accurate construction of the problem; but usually you
will neither know, nor care, exactly how high the building
is, or how far off. In such case draw the line A B, as nearly
as you can guess, about the part of the picture it ought to
occupy, and on such a scale as you choose. Divide it into
any convenient number of equal parts, according to the
height you presume it to be. If you suppose it to be twenty
feet high, you may divide it into twenty parts, and let each
part stand for a foot; if thirty feet high, you may divide it
into ten parts, and let each part stand for three feet; if
seventy feet high, into fourteen parts, and let each part stand
for five feet; and so on, avoiding thus very minute divisions
till you come to details. Then observe how high your eye
reaches upon this vertical line; suppose, for instance, that it
is thirty feet high and divided into ten parts, and you are
standing so as to raise your head to about six feet above its
base, then the sight-line may be drawn, as in the figure,
through the second division from the ground. If you are
standing above the house, draw the sight-line above B; if below
the house, below A; at such height or depth as you suppose
may be accurate (a yard or two more or less matters
little at ordinary distances, while at great distances perspective
rules become nearly useless, the eye serving you better
than the necessarily imperfect calculation). Then fix your
sight-point and station-point, the latter with proper reference
to the scale of the line A B. As you cannot, in all probability,
ascertain the exact direction of the line A V or B V,
draw the slope B V as it appears to you, cutting the sight-line
in V. Thus having fixed one vanishing-point, the other,
and the dividing-points, must be accurately found by rule;
for, as before stated, whether your entire group of points
(vanishing and dividing) falls a little more or less to the
right or left of S does not signify, but the relation of the
points to each other does signify. Then draw the measuring-line
B G, either through A or B, choosing always the steeper
slope of the two; divide the measuring-line into parts of the
same length as those used on A B, and let them stand for the
[p77]
 same magnitudes. Thus, suppose there are two rows of windows
in the house front, each window six feet high by three
wide, and separated by intervals of three feet, both between
window and window and between tier and tier; each of the
divisions here standing for three feet, the lines drawn from
B G to the dividing-point D fix the lateral dimensions, and the
divisions on A B the vertical ones. For other magnitudes it
would be necessary to subdivide the parts on the measuring-line,
or on A B, as required. The lines which regulate the
inner sides or returns of the windows (a, b, c, etc.) of course
are drawn to the vanishing-point of B F (the other side of the
house), if F B V represents a right angle; if not, their own
vanishing-point must be found separately for these returns.
But see Practice on Problem XI.,Fig. 55.,Interior angles, such as E B C, Fig. 55. (suppose the corner
of a room), are to be treated in the same way, each side of
the room having its measurements separately carried to it
from the measuring-line. It may sometimes happen in such
cases that we have to carry the measurement up from the
corner B, and that the sight-magnitudes are given us from
the length of the line A B. For instance, suppose the room
is eighteen feet high, and therefore A B is eighteen feet; and
we have to lay off lengths of six feet on the top of the room
wall, B C. Find D, the dividing-point of B C. Draw a
[p78]
 measuring-line, B F, from B; and another, g C, anywhere
above. On B F lay off B G equal to one third of A B, or six
feet; and draw from D, through G and B, the lines G g, B b,
to the upper measuring-line. Then g b is six feet on that
measuring-line. Make b c, c h, etc., equal to b g; and draw
c e, h f, etc., to D, cutting B C in e and f, which mark the
required lengths of six feet each at the top of the wall.,This is one of the most important foundational problems
in perspective, and it is necessary that the student should
entirely familiarize himself with its conditions.,In order to do so, he must first observe these general
relations of magnitude in any pyramid on a square base.,Let A G H′, Fig. 56., be any pyramid on a square base.,Fig. 56.,The best terms in which its magnitude
can be given, are the length of one side of
its base, A H, and its vertical altitude (C D
in Fig. 25.); for, knowing these, we know
all the other magnitudes. But these are
not the terms in which its size will be
usually ascertainable. Generally, we shall
have given us, and be able to ascertain by
measurement, one side of its base A H, and either A G the
length of one of the lines of its angles, or B G (or B′ G) the
length of a line drawn from its vertex, G, to the middle of
the side of its base. In measuring a real pyramid, A G will
usually be the line most easily found; but in many architectural
problems B G is given, or is most easily ascertainable.,Observe therefore this general construction.,Fig. 57.,Let A B D E, Fig. 57., be the square base
of any pyramid.,Draw its diagonals, A E, B D, cutting
each other in its center, C.,Bisect any side, A B, in F.,From F erect vertical F G.,Produce F B to H, and make F H equal
to A C.,Now if the vertical altitude of the
pyramid (C D in Fig. 25.) be given,
make F G equal to this vertical altitude.,[p80]Join G B and G H.,Then G B and G H are the true magnitudes of G B and G H
in Fig. 56.,If G B is given, and not the vertical altitude, with center
B, and distance G B, describe circle cutting F G in G, and F G
is the vertical altitude.,If G H is given, describe the circle from H, with distance
G H, and it will similarly cut F G in G.,It is especially necessary for the student to examine this
construction thoroughly, because in many complicated forms
of ornaments, capitals of columns, etc., the lines B G and
G H become the limits or bases of curves, which are elongated
on the longer (or angle) profile G H, and shortened on the
shorter (or lateral) profile B G. We will take a simple instance,
but must previously note another construction.,It is often necessary, when pyramids are the roots of some
ornamental form, to divide them horizontally at a given vertical
height. The shortest way of doing so is in general the
following.,Fig. 58.,Let A E C, Fig. 58., be any pyramid on a square base A B C, and A D C the square pillar used in its construction.,[p81]Then by construction (Problem X.) B D and A F are both
of the vertical height of the pyramid.,Of the diagonals, F E, D E, choose the shortest (in this case
D E), and produce it to cut the sight-line in V.,Therefore V is the vanishing-point of D E.,Divide D B, as may be required, into the sight-magnitudes
of the given vertical heights at which the pyramid is to be
divided.,  Fig. 59.  
  Fig. 60.  ,From the points of division, 1, 2, 3, etc., draw to the
vanishing-point V. The lines so drawn cut the angle line of
the pyramid, B E, at the required elevations. Thus, in the
figure, it is required to draw a horizontal black band on the
pyramid at three fifths of its height, and in breadth one
twentieth of its height. The line B D is divided into five
parts, of which three are counted from B upwards. Then
the line drawn to V marks the base of the black band. Then
one fourth of one of the five parts is measured, which similarly
gives the breadth of the band. The terminal lines of
the band are then drawn on the sides of the pyramid parallel
to A B (or to its vanishing-point if it has one), and to the
vanishing-point of B C.,[p82]If it happens that the vanishing-points of the diagonals
are awkwardly placed for use, bisect the nearest base line of
the pyramid in B, as in Fig. 59.,Erect the vertical D B and join G B and D G (G being the
apex of pyramid).,Find the vanishing-point of D G, and use D B for division,
carrying the measurements to the line G B.,In Fig. 59., if we join A D and D C, A D C is the vertical
profile of the whole pyramid, and B D C of the half pyramid,
corresponding to F G B in Fig. 57.,Fig. 61.,We may now proceed to an architectural example.,Let A H, Fig. 60., be the vertical profile of the capital of
a pillar, A B the semi-diameter of its head or abacus, and F D
the semi-diameter of its shaft.,Let the shaft be circular, and the abacus square, down to
the level E.,Join B D, E F, and produce them to meet in G.,Therefore E C G is the semi-profile of a reversed pyramid
containing the capital.,[p83]Construct this pyramid, with the square of the abacus, in
the required perspective, as in Fig. 61.; making A E equal
to A E in Fig. 60., and A K, the side of the square, equal to
twice A B in Fig. 60. Make E G equal to C G, and E D equal
to C D. Draw D F to the vanishing-point of the diagonal D V
(the figure is too small to include this vanishing-point), and
F is the level of the point F in Fig. 60., on the side of the
pyramid.,Draw F m, F n, to the vanishing-points of A H and A K.
Then F n and F m are horizontal lines across the pyramid at
the level F, forming at that level two sides of a square.,Fig. 62.,Complete the square, and within it inscribe a circle, as in
Fig. 62., which is left unlettered that its construction may
be clear. At the extremities of this draw vertical lines,
which will be the sides of the shaft in its right place. It
will be found to be somewhat smaller in diameter than the
entire shaft in Fig. 60., because at the center of the square
it is more distant than the nearest edge of the square abacus.
The curves of the capital may then be drawn approximately
by the eye. They are not quite accurate in Fig. 62., there
[p84]
 being a subtlety in their junction with the shaft which could
not be shown on so small a scale without confusing the student;
the curve on the left springing from a point a little
way round the circle behind the shaft, and that on the right
from a point on this side of the circle a little way within the
edge of the shaft. But for their more accurate construction
see Notes on Problem XIV.,It is seldom that any complicated curve, except occasionally
a spiral, needs to be drawn in perspective; but the student
will do well to practice for some time any fantastic
shapes which he can find drawn on flat surfaces, as on wall-papers,
carpets, etc., in order to accustom himself to the
strange and great changes which perspective causes in them.,Fig. 63.,The curves most required in architectural drawing, after
the circle, are those of pointed arches; in which, however, all
that will be generally needed is to fix the apex, and two
points in the sides. Thus if we have to draw a range of
pointed arches, such as A P B, Fig. 63., draw the measured
arch to its sight-magnitude first neatly in a rectangle, A B C D; then draw the diagonals A D and B C; where they cut
the curve draw a horizontal line (as at the level E in the
figure), and carry it along the range to the vanishing-point,
fixing the points where the arches cut their diagonals all
along. If the arch is cusped, a line should be drawn, at F to
mark the height of the cusps, and verticals raised at G and H,
to determine the interval between them. Any other points
[p86]
 may be similarly determined, but these will usually be enough.
Figure 63. shows the perspective construction of a square
niche of good Veronese Gothic, with an uncusped arch of
similar size and curve beyond.,Fig. 64.,In Fig. 64. the more distant arch only is lettered, as the
construction of the nearest explains itself more clearly to the
eye without letters. The more distant arch shows the general
construction for all arches seen underneath, as of
bridges, cathedral aisles, etc. The rectangle A B C D is first
drawn to contain the outside arch; then the depth of the
arch, A a, is determined by the measuring-line, and the rectangle,
a b c d, drawn for the inner arch.,A a, B b, etc., go to one vanishing-point; A B, a b, etc., to
the opposite one.,In the nearer arch another narrow rectangle is drawn to
determine the cusp. The parts which would actually come
into sight are slightly shaded.,Several exercises will be required on this important
problem.,I. It is required to draw a circular flat-bottomed dish narrower
at the bottom than the top; the vertical depth being
given, and the diameter at the top and bottom.,Fig. 65.,Let a b, Fig. 65., be the diameter of the bottom, a c the
diameter of the top, and a d its vertical depth.,Take A D in position equal to a c.,On A D draw the square A B C D, and inscribe in it a circle.,Therefore, the circle so inscribed has the diameter of the
top of the dish.,From A and D let fall verticals, A E, D H, each equal to a d.,Join E H, and describe square E F G H, which accordingly
will be equal to the square A B C D, and be at the depth a d
beneath it.,Within the square E F G H describe a square I K, whose
diameter shall be equal to a b.,Describe a circle within the square I K. Therefore the
circle so inscribed has its diameter equal to a b; and it is
[p88]
 in the center of the square E F G H, which is vertically beneath
the square A B C D.,Therefore the circle in the square I K represents the bottom
of the dish.,Now the two circles thus drawn will either intersect one
another, or they will not.,If they intersect one another, as in the figure, and they
are below the eye, part of the bottom of the dish is seen
within it.,Fig. 66.,To avoid confusion, let us take then two intersecting circles
without the inclosing squares, as in Fig. 66.,Draw right lines, a b, c d, touching both circles externally.
Then the parts of these lines which connect the circles are
the sides of the dish. They are drawn in Fig. 65. without
any prolongations, but the best way to construct them is as
in Fig. 66.,If the circles do not intersect each other, the smaller must
either be within the larger or not within it.,If within the larger, the whole of the bottom of the dish
is seen from above, Fig. 67. a.,Fig. 67.,If the smaller circle is not within
the larger, none of the bottom is seen
inside the dish, b.,If the circles are above instead of
beneath the eye, the bottom of the
dish is seen beneath it, c.,If one circle is above and another
beneath the eye, neither the bottom
nor top of the dish is seen, d. Unless
the object be very large, the circles in
this case will have little apparent
curvature.,II. The preceding problem is simple,
[p89]
 because the lines of the profile of the object (a b and
c d, Fig. 66.) are straight. But if these lines of profile are
curved, the problem becomes much more complex: once mastered,
however, it leaves no farther difficulty in perspective.,Let it be required to draw a flattish circular cup or vase,
with a given curve of profile.,The basis of construction is given in Fig. 68., half of it
only being drawn, in order that the eye may seize its lines
easily.,Fig. 68.,Two squares (of the required size) are first drawn, one
above the other, with a given vertical interval, A C, between
them, and each is divided into eight parts by its diameters
and diagonals. In these squares two circles are drawn;
which are, therefore, of equal size, and one above the other.
Two smaller circles, also of equal size, are drawn within
these larger circles in the construction of the present problem;
more may be necessary in some, none at all in others.,It will be seen that the portions of the diagonals and diameters
of squares which are cut off between the circles
represent radiating planes, occupying the position of the
spokes of a wheel.,Now let the line A E B, Fig. 69., be the profile of the vase
or cup to be drawn.,Inclose it in the rectangle C D, and if any portion of it is
not curved, as A E, cut off the curved portion by the vertical
line E F, so as to include it in the smaller rectangle F D.,[p90]Draw the rectangle A C B D in position, and upon it construct
two squares, as they are constructed on the rectangle
A C D in Fig. 68.; and complete the construction of Fig. 68.,
making the radius of its large outer circles equal to A D, and
of its small inner circles equal to A E.,The planes which occupy the position of the wheel spokes
will then each represent a rectangle of the size of F D. The
construction is shown by the dotted lines in Fig. 69.; c being
the center of the uppermost circle.,Fig. 69.,Within each of the smaller rectangles between the circles,
draw the curve E B in perspective, as in Fig. 69.,Draw the curve x y, touching and inclosing the curves in
the rectangles, and meeting the upper circle at y.[Footnote 32]
 ,Then x y is the contour of the surface of the cup, and the
upper circle is its lip.,If the line x y is long, it may be necessary to draw other
rectangles between the eight principal ones; and, if the curve
of profile A B is complex or retorted, there may be several
lines corresponding to X Y, inclosing the successive waves of
the profile; and the outer curve will then be an undulating or
broken one.,[p91]Fig. 70.,III. All branched ornamentation, forms of flowers, capitals
of columns, machicolations of round towers, and other such
arrangements of radiating curve, are resolvable by this problem,
using more or fewer interior circles according to the
conditions of the curves. Fig. 70. is an example of the construction
of a circular group of eight trefoils with curved
stems. One outer or limiting circle is drawn within the
square E D C F, and the extremities of the trefoils touch it
at the extremities of its diagonals and diameters. A
[p92]
 smaller circle is at the vertical distance B C below the larger,
and A is the angle of the square within which the smaller
circle is drawn; but the square is not given, to avoid confusion.
The stems of the trefoils form drooping curves, arranged
on the diagonals and diameters of the smaller circle,
which are dotted. But no perspective laws will do work of
this intricate kind so well as the hand and eye of a painter.,IV. There is one common construction, however, in which,
singularly, the hand and eye of the painter almost always
fail, and that is the fillet of any ordinary capital or base of
a circular pillar (or any similar form). It is rarely necessary
in practice to draw such minor details in perspective;
yet the perspective laws which regulate them should be understood,
else the eye does not see their contours rightly
until it is very highly cultivated.,Fig. 71.,Fig. 71. will show the law with sufficient clearness; it
represents the perspective construction of a fillet whose profile
is a semicircle, such as F H in Fig. 60., seen above the
eye. Only half the pillar with half the fillet is drawn, to
avoid confusion.,[p93]Q is the center of the shaft.,P Q the thickness of the fillet, sight-magnitude at the shaft’s
center.,Round P a horizontal semicircle is drawn on the diameter
of the shaft a b.,Round Q another horizontal semicircle is drawn on diameter
c d.,These two semicircles are the upper and lower edges of the
fillet.,Then diagonals and diameters are drawn as in Fig. 68.,
and, at their extremities, semicircles in perspective, as in
Fig. 69.,The letters A, B, C, D, and E, indicate the upper and exterior
angles of the rectangles in which these semicircles are
to be drawn; but the inner vertical line is not dotted in the
rectangle at C, as it would have confused itself with other
lines.,Then the visible contour of the fillet is the line which incloses
and touches[Footnote 33]
  all the semicircles. It disappears behind
the shaft at the point H, but I have drawn it through
to the opposite extremity of the diameter at d.,Turned upside down the figure shows the construction of
a basic fillet.,The capital of a Greek Doric pillar should be drawn frequently
for exercise on this fourteenth problem, the curve
of its echinus being exquisitely subtle, while the general
contour is simple.,[Footnote 32:  This point coincides in the figure with the extremity of the horizontal
diameter, but only accidentally.]
 Return to text,[Footnote 33:  The engraving is a little inaccurate; the inclosing line should
touch the dotted semicircles at A and B. The student should draw it
on a large scale.]
 Return to text,It is often possible to shorten other perspective operations
considerably, by finding the vanishing-points of the inclined
lines of the object. Thus, in drawing the gabled roof in
Fig. 43., if the gable A Y C be drawn in perspective, and the
vanishing-point of A Y determined, it is not necessary to draw
the two sides of the rectangle, A′ D′ and D′ B′, in order to determine
the point Y′; but merely to draw Y Y′ to the vanishing-point
of A A′ and A′ Y′ to the vanishing-point of A Y,
meeting in Y′, the point required.,Again, if there be a series of gables, or other figures produced
by parallel inclined lines, and retiring to the point V,
as in Fig. 72.,[Footnote 34]
  it is not necessary to draw each separately,
but merely to determine their breadths on the line A V, and
draw the slopes of each to their vanishing-points, as shown
in Fig. 72. Or if the gables are equal in height, and a line
be drawn from Y to V, the construction resolves itself into a
zigzag drawn alternately to P and Q, between the lines Y V
and A V.,The student must be very cautious, in finding the vanishing-points
of inclined lines, to notice their relations to the
horizontals beneath them, else he may easily mistake the
horizontal to which they belong.,Thus, let A B C D, Fig. 73., be a rectangular inclined plane,
and let it be required to find the vanishing-point of its diagonal
B D.,Find V, the vanishing-point of A D and B C.,Draw A E to the opposite vanishing-point, so that D A E
may represent a right angle.,Let fall from B the vertical B E, cutting A E in E.,Join E D, and produce it to cut the sight-line in V′.,[p95]Fig. 72.,[p96]Then, since the point E is vertically under the point B, the
horizontal line E D is vertically under the inclined line B D.,Fig. 73.,So that if we now let fall the vertical V′ P from V′, and produce
B D to cut V′ P in P, the point P will be the vanishing-point
of B D, and of all lines parallel to it.[Footnote 35]
 ,[Footnote 34:  The diagram is inaccurately cut. Y V should be a right line.]
Return to text,[Footnote 35: The student may perhaps understand this construction better by
completing the rectangle A D F E, drawing D F to the vanishing-point
of A E, and E F to V. The whole figure, B F, may then be conceived as
representing half the gable roof of a house, A F the rectangle of its base,
and A C the rectangle of its sloping side.,In nearly all picturesque buildings, especially on the Continent, the
slopes of gables are much varied (frequently unequal on the two sides),
and the vanishing-points of their inclined lines become very important,
if accuracy is required in the intersections of tiling, sides of dormer
windows, etc.,Obviously, also, irregular triangles and polygons in vertical planes
may be more easily constructed by finding the vanishing-points of
their sides, than by the construction given in the corollary to Problem IX.; and if such triangles or polygons have others concentrically inscribed
within them, as often in Byzantine mosaics, etc., the use of
the vanishing-points will become essential.]
Return to text,Before examining the last three problems it is necessary
that you should understand accurately what is meant by the
position of an inclined plane.,Cut a piece of strong white pasteboard into any irregular
shape, and dip it in a sloped position into water. However
you hold it, the edge of the water, of course, will always
draw a horizontal line across its surface. The direction of
this horizontal line is the direction of the inclined plane.
(In beds of rock geologists call it their “strike.”),Fig. 74.,Next, draw a semicircle on the piece of pasteboard; draw
its diameter, A B, Fig. 74., and a vertical line from its center,
C D; and draw some other lines, C E, C F, etc., from the center
to any points in the circumference.,Now dip the piece of pasteboard again into water, and,
holding it at any inclination and in any direction you choose,
bring the surface of the water to the line A B. Then the
line C D will be the most steeply inclined of all the lines
drawn to the circumference of the circle; G C and H C will
be less steep; and E C and F C less steep still. The nearer
the lines to C D, the steeper they will be; and the nearer to
A B, the more nearly horizontal.,[p98]When, therefore, the line A B is horizontal (or marks the
water surface), its direction is the direction of the inclined
plane, and the inclination of the line D C is the inclination
of the inclined plane. In beds of rock geologists call the
inclination of the line D C their “dip.”,To fix the position of an inclined plane, therefore, is to
determine the direction of any two lines in the plane, A B
and C D, of which one shall be horizontal and the other at
right angles to it. Then any lines drawn in the inclined
plane, parallel to A B, will be horizontal; and lines drawn
parallel to C D will be as steep as C D, and are spoken of in
the text as the “steepest lines” in the plane.,But farther, whatever the direction of a plane may be, if
it be extended indefinitely, it will be terminated, to the eye
of the observer, by a boundary line, which, in a horizontal
plane, is horizontal (coinciding nearly with the visible horizon);—in
a vertical plane, is vertical;—and, in an inclined
plane, is inclined.,This line is properly, in each case, called the “sight-line”
of such plane; but it is only properly called the “horizon”
in the case of a horizontal plane: and I have preferred using
always the term “sight-line,” not only because more comprehensive,
but more accurate; for though the curvature of the
earth’s surface is so slight that practically its visible limit
always coincides with the sight-line of a horizontal plane, it
does not mathematically coincide with it, and the two lines
ought not to be considered as theoretically identical, though
they are so in practice.,It is evident that all vanishing-points of lines in any plane
must be found on its sight-line, and, therefore, that the sight-line
of any plane may be found by joining any two of such
vanishing-points. Hence the construction of Problem XVIII.,In Fig. 8. omit the lines C D, C′ D′, and D S; and, as here
in Fig. 75., from a draw a d parallel to A B, cutting B T in
d; and from d draw d e parallel to B C′.,Fig. 75.,Now as a d is parallel to A B—,but A C is equal to B C′—,[p100]Now because the triangles a c V, b c′ V, are similar—,and because the triangles d e T, b c′ T are similar—,But a c is equal to d e—,∴ the two triangles a b d, b T V, are similar, and their angles
are alternate;,But a d is parallel to A B—,In Fig. 13., since a R is by construction parallel to A B in
Fig. 12., and T V is by construction in Problem III. also
parallel to A B—,Again, by the construction of Fig. 13., a R′ is parallel to
M V—,And it has just been shown that also,But by construction, a R′ = a R—,We proceed to take up the general condition of the second
problem, before left unexamined, namely, that in which the
vertical distances B C′ and A C (Fig. 6. page 13), as well as
the direct distances T D and T D′ are unequal.,In Fig. 6., here repeated (Fig. 76.), produce C′ B downwards,
and make C′ E equal to C A.,Fig. 76.,Join A E.,Then, by the second Corollary of Problem II., A E is a
horizontal line.,Draw T V parallel to A E, cutting the sight-line in V.,[p103]Complete the constructions of Problem II. and its second
Corollary.,Then by Problem II. a b is the line A B drawn in perspective;
and by its Corollary a e is the line A E drawn in
perspective.,From V erect perpendicular V P, and produce a b to cut
it in P.,Join T P, and from e draw e f parallel to A E, and cutting
A T in f.,Now in triangles E B T and A E T, as e b is parallel to E B
and e f to A E;—e b ∶ e f ∷ E B ∶ A E[eqn x].,But T V is also parallel to A E and P V to e b.,Therefore also in the triangles a P V and a V T,,Therefore P V ∶ V T ∷ E B ∶ A E[eqn xii].,And, by construction, angle T P V = ∠ A E B.,Therefore the triangles T V P, A E B, are similar; and T P
is parallel to A B.,[p104]Now the construction in this problem is entirely general
for any inclined line A B, and a horizontal line A E in the
same vertical plane with it.,So that if we find the vanishing-point of A E in V, and
from V erect a vertical V P, and from T draw T P parallel
to A B, cutting V P in P, P will be the vanishing-point of A B,
and (by the same proof as that given at page 17) of all lines
parallel to it.,Fig. 77.,Next, to find the dividing-point of the inclined line.,I remove some unnecessary lines from the last figure and
repeat it here, Fig. 77., adding the measuring-line a M, that
the student may observe its position with respect to the other
lines before I remove any more of them.,Now if the line A B in this diagram represented the length
of the line A B in reality (as A B does in Figs. 10. and 11.),
we should only have to proceed to modify Corollary III. of
Problem II. to this new construction. We shall see presently
that A B does not represent the actual length of the inclined
line A B in nature, nevertheless we shall first proceed as if it
did, and modify our result afterwards.,[p105]In Fig. 77. draw a d parallel to A B, cutting B T in d.,Therefore a d is the sight-magnitude of A B, as a R is of
A B in Fig. 11.,Fig. 78.,Remove again from the figure all lines except P V, V T, P T,
a b, a d, and the measuring-line.,Set off on the measuring-line a m equal to a d.,Draw P Q parallel to a m, and through b draw m Q, cutting
P Q in Q.,Then, by the proof already given in page 20, P Q = P T.,Therefore if P is the vanishing-point of an inclined line
A B, and Q P is a horizontal line drawn through it, make P Q
equal to P T, and a m on the measuring-line equal to the
sight-magnitude of the line A B in the diagram, and the line
joining m Q will cut a P in b.,We have now, therefore, to consider what relation the
length of the line A B in this diagram, Fig. 77., has to the
length of the line A B in reality.,Now the line A E in Fig. 77. represents the length of A E
in reality.,But the angle A E B, Fig. 77., and the corresponding angle
in all the constructions of the earlier problems, is in reality a
right angle, though in the diagram necessarily represented as
obtuse.,Fig. 79.,Therefore, if from E we draw E C, as in Fig. 79., at right
angles to A E, make E C = E B, and join
A C, A C will be the real length of the line
A B.,Now, therefore, if instead of a m in Fig. 78., we take the real length of A B, that real
length will be to a m as A C to A B in Fig. 79.,And then, if the line drawn to the measuring-line
P Q is still to cut a P in b, it is evident that the
line P Q must be shortened in the same ratio that a m was
shortened; and the true dividing-point will be Q′ in Fig. 80.,
fixed so that Q′ P shall be to Q P as a m′ is to a m; a m′ representing
the real length of A B.,[p106]But a m′ is therefore to a m as A C is to A B in Fig. 79.,Therefore P Q′ must be to P Q as A C is to A B.,But P Q equals P T (Fig. 78.); and P V is to V T (in Fig. 78.) as B E is to A E (Fig. 79.).,Hence we have only to substitute P V for E C, and V T for
A E, in Fig. 79., and the resulting diagonal A C will be the
required length of P Q′.,Fig. 80.,It will be seen that the construction given in the text
(Fig. 46.) is the simplest means of obtaining this magnitude,
for V D in Fig. 46. (or V M in Fig. 15.) = V T by construction
in Problem IV. It should, however, be observed,
that the distance P Q′ or P X, in Fig. 46., may be laid on the
sight-line of the inclined plane itself, if the measuring-line
be drawn parallel to that sight-line. And thus any form may
be drawn on an inclined plane as conveniently as on a horizontal
one, with the single exception of the radiation of the
verticals, which have a vanishing-point, as shown in Problem XX.,THE END.,A handful of unequivocal typographical errors has been corrected.,For increased clarity, a few diagrams have been shifted from their original
position in the text.,Images for sections of the text where the ∶ ratio
