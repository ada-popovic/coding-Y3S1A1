,,LONDON:HARDWICKE AND BOGUE, 192 PICCADILLY.1876.,,,,[Pg 5],[Pg 5],[Pg 5],PREFACE.,PREFACE.,“The proof of the Fungus is in the eating.” I have
constantly eaten every species figured on the “Edible Sheet,” and many
others that are not. Few, I imagine, will expect me to have eaten every
species on the “Poisonous Sheet,” bearing, as they do, such adjective
names as “gloomy,” “fiery,” “satanical,” “inflaming,” &c.,The proof of the,Fungus,is in the eating.,However, years ago, without a proper guide and with very little
experience, I more than once became personally acquainted with the
unpleasant qualities of one or two dangerous species, the particulars
of which will be found in the proper place.
[Pg 6],one or two dangerous species,[Pg 6],[Pg 6],If the following brief descriptions are used in connection with the two
sheets of drawings, which I have copied from nature and transferred to
the stones myself (or in reference to the large drawings in the Bethnal
Green Museum), no one who is capable of distinguishing one thing from
another need fear making a mistake.,I shall be glad to give information regarding any species forwarded to
me carriage paid.,W. G. SMITH.,15, Mildmay Grove, London, N.,15, Mildmay Grove, London, N.,,[Pg 7],[Pg 7],[Pg 7],INDEX TO POPULAR NAMES.,INDEX TO POPULAR NAMES.,(E. refers to Edible, and P. to Poisonous Sheet;

,“...... Oh, who can tell,The hidden power of hearbes, and might of magicke spell?”,Spenser.,Spenser.,Perhaps no other country can vie with Great Britain in the vast number
of edible species of fungi that may be gathered during all seasons
of the year, from one end of the land to the other. The pastures and
woodlands literally teem with them; they are, however (sad to say),
little known, sadly neglected, or looked upon with unmerited suspicion.
The literature, too, of the subject is so small, and the scientific
part of the study so extremely difficult to begin, that few persons
dare venture to test the qualities of any fungus except the meadow
mushroom, and instances are common enough where even this species is
rejected. It is apparent that no one can be a sure guide to others who
is not himself a “regular fungus eater,” and that no descriptions
can be of value, or drawings of use, unless they are taken with the
greatest care from the objects themselves. To the best of my ability,
[Pg 12]
I have attempted this, and wish to persuade others to test the rare
gastronomic qualities of the twenty-nine species figured. The number
here described and drawn is only a very small portion of the really
valuable species, for I well know that, as a beginner in the study, I
made all sorts of mistakes; but, with one exception, I seldom suffered
much inconvenience, and I even know instances where confessedly
poisonous species have been eaten without ill effect. A little
prudence, too often neglected, should be observed in the consumption of
fungi: for instance, only young, fresh, and sound specimens should be
gathered for the table—for if stale, semi-putrid, and worm-eaten plants
are chosen, they are as likely to produce indigestion and inconvenience
as meat in a similar condition; they should be eaten in moderation, as
a surfeit of sweet mushrooms is as likely to disarrange one’s digestive
organs as a surfeit of pastry. If these precautions are attended to,
and a moderate amount of bread, salt, pepper, and common sense is used,
no accident need occur. Let the specimens be cooked as soon as possible
after gathering.,eater,[Pg 12],[Pg 12],Although the following statement may be difficult to understand, it
is nevertheless a fact, that many men do not know what a mushroom is
at all, but will eat anything. I will give an instance: A year or
two ago, a man in the north of England cooked a large batch of what
he called mushrooms, for supper, and succeeded in poisoning his wife
and family to death, and himself nearly to death. Some of the things
[Pg 13]
he cooked were sent to me for identification, and lo! he had gathered
everything he could lay his hands upon; large and small, sweet and
foul—off horsedung, and rotten palings, and from wherever he could
find anything with a stalk and a top to it after the manner of an
umbrella. When he had buried his family and recovered his own health,
he carelessly walked into a well, and either killed or much damaged
himself—I forget which. I mention this to show the sort of men they
are who poison themselves with mushrooms. They would poison themselves
with anything else if they had the opportunity; would get under a
cart-wheel, or do any absurd thing.,do not know what a mushroom is
at all, but will eat anything,death,[Pg 13],[Pg 13],The twenty-nine species figured on the “Edible Sheet” are most of them
abundant, and instantly recognizable when seen, and every one is a
wholesome and delicious object of food, full of aroma and flavour. I
invite my readers to partake of the bountiful feast spread in our rich
pastures and shady woodlands all over the country for all who care to
partake.,“Mushrooms and Toadstools.”—These two words embrace the whole of the
knowledge possessed by the people at large regarding the immense
fungus tribe of this country. If we take the mushroom type of fungus
as an example, we have some seven hundred species, all possessing a
certain general similitude of form. This has caused many to look upon
fungi in common as equivocal productions, difficult or impossible to
distinguish as permanent species; but when the study is once entered upon
[Pg 14]
in earnest, the student will soon perceive that the species, as a
rule, are marked with great distinctness and permanency, rendering the
recognition of most of them as certain as in any species of flowering
plant.,[Pg 14],[Pg 14],When the study of the whole of the British Fungi is embraced, it is
true there are many difficulties in the way, for we find some plants
closely approaching the algæ and others the lichens; but when it is
only the larger fungi that it is proposed to discriminate, the task is
much easier, the number being limited to about twelve hundred species.
If the orders Agaricini and Polyporei
[Pg 15]
(including more than eight of the twelve hundred species) are taken as a
rough type of the larger fungi, it will be seen that these plants consist
principally of a stem and cap. Unlike the flowering plant, the mushroom
has no root; but, in place of it, the mycelium, or spawn, from which
the fungus springs. Under the top are certain gills or plates, tubes,
pores or spines, that bear the spores (or seeds). These spores are
distinguished from true seeds by having no embryo, a spore consisting
simply of a two-coated cell with no trace of an embryo. These spores
are microscopic objects of various forms, sizes, and colours, the
produce of one plant reaching, it is said, the enormous number of
ten millions; when they fall upon the earth, or any suitable matrix,
they germinate and form the spawn which eventually produces an infant
fungus, the exact counterpart of the original producer of the spores.,Agaricini,Polyporei,[Pg 15],[Pg 15],two-coated cell with no trace of an embryo,We have but one species popularly recognized as esculent—viz., the
common meadow mushroom (Agaricus campestris). A very near ally of
the “meadow mushroom,” and a most delicious species when fresh,—viz.,
the so-called “horse mushroom” (Agaricus arvensis)—is nearly always
rejected by country-folks as dangerous. This large and wholesome
species is the one commonly sold in Covent Garden Market as the true
mushroom, where, if fresh specimens can be procured, it is a welcome
addition to the table. The fairy-ring Champignon (certainly one of the
most exquisitely delicious of all our fungi) is generally neglected,
or regarded with great suspicion. Under the name of “champillion,”
however, it is well known to the weavers and labouring men of the east
of London, who may be seen gathering it in considerable numbers any
autumn day amongst the short grass of Victoria Park. The fragrant and
luscious “Chantarelle,” the “rare Morel,” and the sweet and tender
giant puff-ball, are almost universally kicked aside or altogether
neglected. Amongst the species supposed to be popular is Agaricus
personatus, said to be sold in Covent Garden Market. I have never seen
it there, or heard of its presence. In the West of England and some
other places I have heard these plants called “Blue-its” (Blewits),
in reference to the blue colour round the upper part of the stem. It
is a most substantial and delicious species, and should be better
known; but I imagine it is rather uncommon, as I have seldom gathered
[Pg 16]
it; although till quite lately it grew near Highbury Barn. The St.
George’s mushroom, springing up on our lawns and pastures in spring
(Agaricus gambosus), is little known, and very seldom eaten. Closely
allied to the A. personatus, it is, if possible, more delicious, and
may be easily dried for winter use. The semi-popular scaly mushroom,
Agaricus procerus (except to fungologists), is known to very few,
but its esculent properties are of a very high order, and it has the
merit of being common. It is said to be sometimes sold in Covent Garden
Market, but I have never seen it there, neither do I know anyone who
has. With the truffle, the list must close of such fungi as are now
and then eaten on exceptional occasions, or may be imperfectly known
to a few who have not studied the subject. This species appears in
our markets in limited quantities (there being very little demand for
it), and realizes from 2s. 6d. to 5s. per pound. The statement
that they fetch from 15s. to 20s. per pound in the London markets
is, I believe, incorrect. It must also be remembered that our English
truffles do not belong to the same species as the delicious truffles
sold in the French markets.,Agaricus campestris,Agaricus arvensis,fresh,kicked,supposed,Agaricus
personatus,[Pg 16],[Pg 16],Agaricus gambosus,A. personatus,Agaricus procerus,s.,d.,s.,s.,s.,There is no other way of distinguishing a poisonous from an edible
fungus than by finding out its name; there is no magic way of saving
the trouble of learning, by the insertion of a silver spoon in a
stew. If, on tasting a fungus, it burns the tongue like the contact
of scalding water (as several species do), the probability is that it
[Pg 17]
is not edible; but if, on the contrary, a species exhales a delicious
and inviting fragrance resembling fruit, spice, or new flour, it is
probably worth a trial, and, even if not figured on the “Edible
Sheet,” may be cautiously tried for the table if so desired.,[Pg 17],[Pg 17],if not,An important character to be observed in fungi is the presence of a
volva, or matrix, at the base of the stem (present in figs. 7 and
8, absent in figs. 11 and 12, Poisonous Sheet), and in
the annulus, or ring, round the stem towards the top (present in figs. 1 and 7,
absent in figs. 14 and 15, Poisonous Sheet). In the determination of
species a great deal depends, too, upon the colour of the spores, or
seeds. These are readily obtained by removing the stalk of the species
to be examined, and placing the top gills lowermost on a piece of
glass. In a few hours the spores will be deposited in a thick dust,
and will vary (according to the species) from pure white to pink,
yellow, red, brown, purple, or jet black. The gills often take their
colours from the spores. It is a very great mistake to imagine that
the “Sudden Mushroom” grows in a single night. The growth of mushrooms
takes a considerable time—often many weeks. The young fungi exist
just beneath or upon the surface of the earth in a compressed and
narrowed compass. It is during this period that all the cells are
formed, and the mushroom itself fashioned; but, being in a squeezed
and concentrated form, it is commonly overlooked. On the advent of
a wet or humid night, the cells forming the fungus are expanded and
[Pg 18]
stretched out, and the mushroom is consequently thrust considerably
above the surface of the pasture; but, although it is much larger in
size, it is no heavier, neither has the substance itself considerably
increased. Mushrooms can be artificially propagated from the seeds or
spores, but not, generally, during the first season of setting. I have
frequently grown the fragile and deliquescent species common on manure
from the seeds; but, even when the spawn is once formed, it is often
many weeks before the little heads are developed into the true figure
of the parents, even in the inky, fugitive and deliquescent species.
Coprinus atramentarius can be readily grown from spores; if planted
about rotten wood in the autumn, the fungi will appear in the late
spring, and give two crops a year till the soil is exhausted. I have
exhibited a cultivated variety of this species at the meetings of the
Royal Horticultural Society.,figs. 7,8,figs. 11,12, Poisonous Sheet,figs. 1,7,figs. 14,15, Poisonous Sheet,[Pg 18],[Pg 18],Coprinus atramentarius,I have not thought it necessary to repeat long descriptions of how
the various species may, or may not, be cooked; it has been done to a
great extent before. It is apparent that the addition of “good beef
gravy,” “a few slices of fowl,” “rich veal stuffing,” and various
other savoury condiments, must occasionally give an extra zest to a
dish of mushrooms; but broiled, stewed, or pickled, most species are
“always good alike”; indeed, mushrooms, in their whole composition,
resemble meat in so remarkable a manner, that any methods of cookery
in vogue for delicate preparations of meat, apply with equal force
[Pg 19]
to mushrooms. Mrs. Hussey and Mr. Cooke each give a large number of
récipés for preparing these vegetables for the table; and to any
reader who may wish to go deeper into the culinary branch of fungology,
I must refer them to these authors. I must confess that I consider
no preparation of mushrooms can exceed the delicious, inviting, and
grateful flavour possessed by mushrooms when simply fried with butter,
salt, and pepper.,[Pg 19],[Pg 19],récipés,The various species suitable for storing up for future use—such as the
Morel, Champignon, &c.—may be readily dried in a current of air, in a
sunny window, or in a cool oven, and then kept in tins, or threaded on
strings and kept in a very dry place. Occasionally this process goes
a step further, and the mushrooms (of any species) are dried to such
an extent as to be readily pulverized; the dust is then known and sold
as “mushroom powder.” Housewives will now and then pickle mushrooms,
by throwing them into scalding vinegar, allowing them to boil for ten
minutes or so, and then, by adding cayenne, mace, nutmeg, or spices,
adapt them to their various tastes.,The liquor extracted from the various edible mushrooms, under
the name of “ketchup,” is used in every kitchen, and the mode of
preparation is probably known to all. It simply consists of placing
the freshly-gathered plants in earthen jars with layers of salt; after
a few hours the ketchup exudes in abundance from the fungi; and the
process is ultimately completed by mashing the remains of the mushrooms
with the hands. It should then be strained and boiled with spice and
[Pg 20]
pepper, or strained and bottled, and the corked and scaled bottles
placed for several hours in boiling water. The ketchup should then be
kept in a cool and very dry place.,[Pg 20],[Pg 20],Nearly every species figured on the Edible Sheet will produce ketchup
of good quality, if treated with salt in an earthen jar. The Champignon
and Horse Mushroom may be specially referred to as producing this
condiment of an excellent quality.,The juice exuded from the truffle in boiling is highly relished by
many, as is the deep blood-red juice that runs from the “liver fungus”
when cut. This, when seasoned with salt and pepper, and boiled, has a
very delicious and stimulating flavour.,Since these notes and the following descriptions were written, my
friend Mr. F. C. Penrose, architect, has sent me a list of twenty-eight
species he has eaten, most of which are figured on the “Edible Sheet”;
the other species mentioned by him and not figured on the sheet are
referred to in the descriptions.,The nomenclature of the species is the same with that given by the Rev.
M. J. Berkeley in his “Outlines of British Fungology”; the numbers
inserted after the scientific name refer to my large drawings in the
Food Department of the Bethnal Green Museum, where, if the student so
desires, he may see dissections of the species.,scientific,,[Pg 21],[Pg 21],[Pg 21],EDIBLE MUSHROOMS.,EDIBLE MUSHROOMS.,,,,Red-fleshed Mushroom.

first appearance in early summer and continuing till late in the
autumn. It is known by its brown warty top, its white gills, and
perfect ring encircling the bulbous stem. It frequently attains a
large size, and its whole substance, when touched, bruised, or broken,
becomes sienna-red. This species is one of the most beautiful as well
as valuable of all the British Agarics. If care be taken to select
young and fresh specimens only, when prepared for the table, it will
prove a very light and delicate addition to any meal. Mr. Berkeley does
not subscribe to the excellence of this species; but as far as my own
experience and that of many friends go, I well know it to be delicious

the summer or early autumn rains, this fungus is one of our commonest
and most delicious species. Like the last, it grows in woods and
forests, and may be at once known by the following characters: it is
generally very stout, with a smooth, umber, cushion-shaped top, tubes
at first white and ultimately pale yellowish-green; stem whitish-brown,
marked with a minute white and very elegant reticulated network,
principally near the top of the ringless stem; when cut or broken, the
fleshy body of the plant continues pure white. In this, as in every
other species, sound young specimens should be selected, and it is
perhaps as well to scrape away the tubes before preparation for the
table. Whether boiled, stewed with salt, pepper, and butter, fried,
or roasted with onions and butter, this species proves itself one of

the most delicious and tender objects of food ever submitted to the
operation of cooking. It is not the plant referred to by the ancient

taste; white, rigid, sometimes branched, gills; white flesh; white,
solid, fleshy, ringless stem; and firm top, variable in colour, which
is at first convex, at last concave. The colour of the thin viscid
skin covering the top of the fungus is commonly subdued green, but (as
its name indicates) the colour is variable: at one time it approaches
greenish-yellow, or lilac, and at another grey or obscure purple;
but it is so common and well marked that, with the assistance of the
figure, there is no fear of mistaking it for anything else. There is
a stouter, more rigid plant, with forked gills and a bitter taste
(R. furcata), that had better be avoided. A third green Russula (R.

popularly recognized in this country as edible. It is common in rich
meadows everywhere, perhaps all over the world, and varies in a
remarkable manner, by imperceptible gradations approaching and blending
with the horse mushroom, fig. 9: its varieties are distinguished by
five or six different names, but the characters run into each other so
[Pg 25]
much, and are frequently so slight and transient, that they are
often difficult to appreciate. One form is found growing in woods
(A. silvicola). I have often gathered it in the Highgate woods, but
from its suspicious aspect would not advise its general use; though I have
frequently eaten it with no ill effect. There is another most beautiful
variety I have frequently gathered in the meadows on the south side of
Lord Mansfield’s woods at Hampstead (A. pratensis), with a very hairy
top, the hairs grouped in patches like ermine. When broken, the flesh
changes to a pale but vivid rose-colour. If possible, this form exceeds
in excellence and piquancy of flavour the common form of our pastures.
Several very distinct varieties are cultivated in beds and stoves,
which occasionally appear in our markets; but none exceed our delicious
indigenous meadow mushroom, as found in the autumn in rich pastures.,fig. 9,[Pg 25],[Pg 25],A. silvicola,A. pratensis,Bonâ fide mushrooms are known by their beautiful pink gills (in which
state they are best fit for use), ultimately becoming deep brown, and
not reaching the stem, which stem carries a well-marked white woolly
ring; by the very fleshy down-covered top, the delicious and enticing
fragrance and the firm white flesh, sometimes inclined to pink when cut
or broken: the plant is so well known and so highly esteemed in this
country that it is hardly necessary to say a word in its favour, or
repeat methods of preparing it for the table. Butter, spice, parsley,
[Pg 26]
sweet herbs, salt, pepper, and sometimes the squeeze of a lemon, appear
to be in the greatest request; but whether boiled, pickled, stewed,
fried, or prepared in any other way, it is equally delicious in all. It
seldom appears in Covent Garden Market; the dealers there are content
to find a sale, at a high price, for stale horse mushrooms. Much has
been written at various times regarding the apocryphal “inspector of
the Roman markets,” who consigns mushrooms to the Tiber, but the facts
have been much exaggerated. Agaricus campestris is not generally
appreciated in Italy, is seldom eaten, and never appears in the
markets, for the simple reason that there would be no sale for it.
There is an edict in existence ordering certain fungi to be thrown into
the Tiber, but it is now, and has long been, altogether effete; and
whilst there is an abundance of A. cæsareus (by some said to be the
most delicious of all fungi) for the markets of Italy, it is not to be
expected that the consumption of this latter plant will be given up for
another and less-known species. It is probable that Agaricus cæsareus
may one day be found in the southern parts of this country; if so, it
will be known by its smooth wartless crimson top, its yellow gills,
and stout white stem springing from a large wrapper at the base (like
fig. 7, Poisonous Sheet).,Bonâ fide,[Pg 26],[Pg 26],Agaricus campestris,A. cæsareus,Agaricus cæsareus,wartless,like

the species appeared likely to yield a black juice.,[Pg 27],[Pg 27],I have known cows to be very fond of mushrooms; and a friend of mine in
the country (who has more than once seen his cows, in the morning, go
from mushroom to mushroom till all are consumed) goes regularly over

in, to secure the first gathering of the fungus crop. Sheep, squirrels,

and solid; the whole plant fleshy, and frequently very large. The gills
immediately distinguish it from the emetic mushroom (fig. 21, Poisonous

there are, too, other great differences between the two species noted
in the description of the emetic mushroom.,fig. 21, Poisonous

many districts; its solid, ringless stem, fleshy body, thick swollen
veins in the place of gills, and brilliant yellow colour, at once serve
to distinguish it from every other species. “Its smell,” says Berkeley,
“is like that of ripe apricots.” Sometimes (as I have frequently seen
in Epping Forest and elsewhere) immense numbers grow together; at
other times they are very few. Chantarelles often cover a hedge-bank
where there are trees close by; and wherever they do appear they must enlist
[Pg 29]
the admiration of the passer-by, for they look as if made of
solid gold. When cooked, this species has a rich mushroom-like flavour
peculiarly its own, and may be prepared for the table in various ways,
according to the fancy of the consumer: but being big and solid, it
should be cut up; and, if stewed, allowed to simmer gently, and be
served with pepper, salt, and butter. There is a curious, thin, pale,
slender variety, found growing in pastures about old stumps, which I
have never eaten, and from its curious aspect, habitat, and comparative
rarity, I think it hardly worth the experiment, but it may be esculent.

is coarser, and has not the same delicious flavour. It is usually
much larger, often attaining enormous dimensions; and it turns a
brownish-yellow as soon as broken or bruised. The top in good specimens
is smooth and snowy white; the gills are not the pure pink of the
meadow mushroom, but dirty brownish-white, ultimately becoming brown
black. It has a big, ragged, floccose ring, and its pithy stem is
inclined to be hollow. It is the species exposed for sale in Covent
Garden Market. Indeed, after knowing the market for many years, I have
[Pg 30]
rarely seen any other species there; when the true mushroom, however,
is there, it is frequently mingled with horse mushrooms, which seems
to show that the dealers do not know one from the other. In the wet
days of autumn, children, idlers, and beggars go a few miles from town
into the meadows to gather whatever they can find in the mushroom
line; they then bring their dirty stock to market, where it is sold to
fashionable purchasers; stale, vapid, and with no taste but a bad one.,A. exquisitus,the,[Pg 30],[Pg 30],is,When young and fresh, the horse mushroom is a most desirable addition
to the bill of fare; it yields an abundant gravy, and the flesh is firm

stale it becomes tough and leathery, and without aroma or juice.,There is a curious large, brown, hairy variety, of rather uncommon
occurrence, similar to the hairy variety of the meadow mushroom,
the A. villaticus of Dr. Badham (given in error by the Rev. M. J.
Berkeley as a variety of the meadow mushroom, and since corrected by him).
It is a splendid plant, but, I think, very rare. I have only seen it once.,A. villaticus,There is also another large, sienna-red, rank-looking variety, I have
often gathered in certain situations under trees, &c., that few would
be tempted to eat; it is probably a luxuriant, overgrown, disagreeable
thing, that would give one a stomach-ache, and in place of better
species is not worth experimenting upon.

mushroom, and have a great antipathy to the latter, although they are
always willing to put it into the jar as one of the ingredients of

of this species. Mr. Penrose writes—“I think young, and especially
button specimens of this, very indigestible; until they are well opened
out, they are unfit for use.” Such, however, I must say, is not my
experience of button specimens.,There is a strong odour attached both to this fungus and its spawn,
the ground just below the surface being frequently white with the
latter. If horsedung be kicked aside in a rich pasture frequented
by graminivorous animals, the earth will frequently present a snowy
whiteness from the spawn of this species, from which the young

in pastures, and is known by its long bulbous spotted stem, by the ring
that will slip up and down, by the very scaly top, and the gills far
removed from the insertion of the stalk. When the stem is removed, a

changes colour to a deep yellowish-brown when broken, and has a smooth

elm trunks, although it is not at all particular as to its habitat,
often appearing on laburnum, apple, ash, &c. It usually grows in large
masses, one plant above another, forming a very handsome object on
old tree-stems. The gills and spores are white, the former running
down the stem, and the top dingy—sometimes nearly white; at others,
full brown. An allied species, A. euosmus, with pale lilac spores,
and a scent like that of Tarragon (Artemisia dracunculus), is
[Pg 39]
“not esculent,” and is said to grow in the spring. I commonly find the
former growing in spring, although it is said usually to grow late in
the autumn, or winter.,elm,and spores are white,A. euosmus,Artemisia dracunculus,[Pg 39],[Pg 39],Perhaps a taste for this species has to be acquired; but though it
is without doubt edible, I have never thought well of it. The flesh
possesses a certain amount of firmness, and produces an abundant and
savoury juice; but I am inclined to place it as the species of least
value for culinary purposes. It has, however, been highly recommended
by some; and a dish of this species stewed before a very hot fire has
proved as enjoyable and nourishing “as half a pound of fresh meat.”
Tastes are allowed to differ; and perhaps the opinion of some of my
readers may differ from mine if they try this species, which, from its
peculiar appearance, there is little chance of mistaking for any other.,,,Lilac-stemmed Mushroom.

very common. It is very nearly allied to and extremely like the next
species (fig. 19), from which it is principally distinguished
by its growing in the autumn, and having a lilac band round the upper part of
the stem. This lilac stain, however, is not invariably present; and a

species that is altogether (stem and top too) lilac, or full violet,
should be avoided (A. nudus). The Purple Cobweb-Mushroom (fig.

personatus they are white—sometimes dirty white; the solid ringless
stem is rather rough; and the top is smooth, and exceedingly firm and
fleshy; the plant grows late in the autumn, on downs, and in rich,
short pastures.,fig. 19,[Pg 40],[Pg 40],A. nudus,fig.

more truly delicious. From my own experience, I have the highest
opinion of it; but the plant readily absorbs moisture, and during wet
weather is heavy and of little worth.,dry weather,As these pages are passing through the press, my friend, Mr. Thomas
Moore, of the Botanic Garden, Chelsea, informs me that this autumn

request amongst housewives, north and south, for the truly exquisite
flavour it imparts to gravies and made dishes; and being readily dried,
it can be kept for immediate use at any season of the year. The figure
shows exactly what the Morel is like; the honeycombed pitted top is
hollow, and the almost smooth stem partly so. It yields a delicious

gills, distinguish it from the other milk-mushrooms.,It grows in woods and meadows.,,,False Chantarelle.

Fig. 19.,Fig. 19.,Fig. 19.,Fig. 19.,(Cantharellus aurantiacus.)540.,Cantharellus aurantiacus.,540.,Is known by its smaller size, its gills being far thinner and more
crowded than in the true chantarelle; the stem frequently deep umber at
the base, and the gills or veins darker than the top.,It is a species to be rejected for culinary purposes.,,,Yellow Milk-Mushroom.

Fig. 20.,Fig. 20.,Fig. 20.,Fig. 20.,(Lactarius theiogalus.)503.,Lactarius theiogalus.,503.,This is a beautiful plant, with an odour that is far from disagreeable.
It is sometimes without the zones on the top which are shown in our
figure, but it is immediately known by the change of colour which takes
[Pg 59]
place in the milk on breaking the fungus; this is at first pure
white, but in less than a minute the milk turns to a brilliant yellow.,sometimes,[Pg 59],[Pg 59],It is not uncommon, and may generally be found at Hampstead in the
woods; and it is supposed to be poisonous.,,,Emetic Mushroom.
Fig. 21.,Emetic Mushroom.
Fig. 21.,Fig. 21.,Fig. 21.,Fig. 21.,(Russula emetica.)528.,Russula emetica.,528.,This is a magnificent but certainly rare species, but it has a very bad
name, and is supposed to possess highly dangerous qualities. The skin
is scarlet, and may be readily peeled off, and then the pink flesh is
displayed beneath, which is its great characteristic; the gills are
pure white, and do not reach the stem; the top is highly polished, and
varies from scarlet and crimson to a faint rose-colour, and may now and
then be found shaded with purple.,It attains a large size, and loves damp places in woods, and the
neighbourhood of trees.,,,Slimy Dung-Mushroom.

everywhere; the stem is covered with a glutinous thick slime.

but handsome species now and then puts in an appearance. It has
a particularly nasty penetrating smell, which has been compared
with “gas-tar.” The stem is firm, as is the whole plant, and
sulphur-coloured.,It is probably a very dangerous species, but I have seldom met with it.,,,Incrusted Mushroom.

Fig. 24.,Fig. 24.,Fig. 24.,Fig. 24.,(Agaricus [Hebelonia] crustuliniformis.)278.,Agaricus,Hebelonia,crustuliniformis.,278.,Growing in woods, this deleterious species is extremely common, and
without doubt very dangerous. The dirty pale-umber gills, and its
habitat and time of growth—viz. the autumn—at once distinguish it from
the delicious A. gambosus, fig. 19, Edible Sheet. It has
a powerful and highly disagreeable odour, and brown spores, and we believe it is
often mistaken by the ignorant for the true mushroom.,A. gambosus,fig. 19, Edible Sheet,,,Verdigris Mushroom.

[Pg 61]
permanent, but consists of green slime that soon gets washed off by the
rain, flaked with white scales. The stem is hollow, and the top fleshy.,[Pg 61],[Pg 61],It generally grows about stumps, is a very handsome fungus, and is
doubtless poisonous.,,,Fiery Tube-Mushroom.

Fig. 26.,Fig. 26.,Fig. 26.,Fig. 26.,(Boletus piperatus.)597.,Boletus piperatus.,597.,Never attains a larger size than the specimen on the sheet; indeed it
is one of the smallest of all the Boleti. The taste is highly acrid;
it is therefore looked upon with grave suspicion, and it is probably a
very dangerous plant.,Boleti,It grows in woods, but is rare.,,,Satanical Tube-Mushroom.

during an architectural excursion to St. Cross. I have only once
seen anything of it elsewhere, though my late friend Mrs. Gulson, of
Eastcliff, has sent it on to me several times from the neighbourhood of
Teignmouth.,Without doubt it is by far the most splendid of all the Boleti. The
top is nearly white, very fleshy, and a little viscid; the stem is
firm, exquisitely coloured, and beautifully reticulated; the under
[Pg 62]
surface is brilliant crimson. It usually attains a large size, grows in
woods, and as soon as broken or bruised, changes to blue.,Boleti,[Pg 62],[Pg 62],In all likelihood it is highly poisonous.,,,Pungent Milk-Mushroom.

Fig. 28.,Fig. 28.,Fig. 28.,Fig. 28.,(Lactarius acris.)505.,Lactarius acris.,505.,As its name indicates, this is a very acrid and dangerous fungus. It
is said to be rare, but I have sometimes known it to be extremely
abundant in the woods near London. When cut or broken, the flesh and
white milk change to a dull-sienna red; this distinguishes it from all
other mushrooms. To observe the change of colour it requires at times a
little patience; for I have known half an hour, or even an hour, elapse
before the change of colour is manifest.,,,Bitter Tube-Mushroom.

Fig. 29.,Fig. 29.,Fig. 29.,Fig. 29.,(Boletus felleus.)617.,Boletus felleus.,617.,Said to be rare, but generally abundant in Epping Forest. I have found
it in abundance in Nottinghamshire, and know it well; it was the first
Boletus I ever drew, and I was then nearly eating it for Boletus
edulis.,Boletus
edulis,The bitter taste of B. felleus, the flesh-coloured tubes, the
flesh-colour of the top when broken, the reticulated stem, and the pink
spores are the distinguishing marks of this species. It is poisonous.

narrower, darker, and crowded gills, distinguish this counterfeit from
the true champignon (fig. 28, Edible Sheet). It sometimes accompanies
the latter plant, but with ordinary care can be detected in a moment.
It grows in woods, as well as in pastures and by roadsides.,fig. 28, Edible Sheet,woods,I think I was once poisoned by it in Bedfordshire. I well remember,
on my way home late one evening, gathering a quantity of champignons
for supper; and as it was dark, I imagine I must have gathered both
species. I did not cook them myself, neither did I examine them after
they were taken from the basket; but I noticed at supper-time that they
were unusually hot, and I thought the old woman who cooked them had put
too much pepper into the stew. I never suspected the fungi.,In about half an hour after partaking of them my head began to ache, my
brain to swim, and my throat and stomach to burn, as if in contact with
fire. After being ill for some hours, a terrible fit of purging and
vomiting set in, which appeared soon to set me to rights; for after a
day or so I was no worse for it.

revolting. Flies, however, appear to highly relish it; for these
Phalli are invariably covered with flies, who greedily devour the
odorous and liquid repast found at the top of the stem. It is most
abundant at woody places in the north of London, all through the summer

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
