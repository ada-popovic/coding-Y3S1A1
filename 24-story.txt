misery and recuperation as the cockpit of
Europe, had with a hundred years of the
peaceful fruition of the intelligence, courage,
thrift, and industry of its people,
emerged as the beehive of the Continent.
Its population of 8,000,000 upon an area
of little less than Maryland was supported
by the importation of raw materials, and
by their manufacture and their exchange
over-seas for two-thirds of the vital
necessities of its daily life.,Belgium,When in the summer of 1914 the people
were again drawn into the European
maelstrom, 600,000 of them became fugitives
abroad, and the remainder were re[viii]duced
to the state of a city which, captured
by a hostile army, is in turn besieged
from without. Thus, its boundaries were
a wall of bayonets and a blockading fleet.,[viii],[viii],Under modern economic conditions, no
importing nation carries more than a few
weeks’ reserve stock of food, depending
as it does upon the daily arrivals of commerce;
and the cessation of this inflow,
together with the destruction and requisition
of their meager stocks, threatened
the Belgians with an even greater catastrophe—the
loss of their very life.,With the stoppage of the industrial
clock, their workpeople were idle, and destitution
marched day and night into their
slender savings, until to-day three and a
half million people must be helped in
charity.,The Belgians are a self-reliant people
who had sought no favors of the world,
and their first instinct and continuing endeavor
has been to help themselves. Not
[ix]only were all those who had resources insistent
that they should either pay now or
in the future for their food, but far beyond
this, they have insisted upon caring
for their own destitute to the fullest extent
of those remaining resources—the
charity of the poor toward the poor. They
have themselves set up no cry for benevolence,
but the American Relief Commission
has insisted upon pleading to the
world to help in a burden so far beyond
their ability.,[ix],[ix],This Commission was created in order
that by agreement with the belligerents
on both sides, a door might be opened in
the wall of steel, through which those who
had resources could re-create the flow of
supplies to themselves; that through the
same channel, the world might come to
the rescue of the destitute, and beyond
this that it could guarantee the guardianship
of these
