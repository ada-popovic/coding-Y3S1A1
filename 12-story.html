ENGLISH EDITION,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,To be had:,of TH. DE DILLMONT, DORNACH, Alsace,
and at all booksellers, and embroidery shops.,Price, English bound with gilt edges:,The absolute want of any comprehensive book on
needlework—such an one as contains both verbal and
pictorial descriptions of everything included under the
name of needlework—has led me to put into the serviceable
form of an Encyclopedia, all the knowledge and
experience, which years of unceasing study and practice
have enabled me to accumulate on the subject, with the
hope that diligent female workers of all ages, may be able,
by its means to instruct themselves in every branch of
plain and fancy needlework.,All the patterns given, even the most insignificant,
were worked afresh for the purpose, and thus, not merely
faithful representations, but also lucid and intelligible
explanations of the same, are secured.,In order that my readers may have something besides
the dull theory, the work is enlivened by a number of
useful patterns, some new, some derived from the artistic
productions of such countries and epochs as have
become famous by special excellence in the domain of
needlework.,Though, at first sight, the reproduction of many of
these patterns may seem to present insuperable difficulties,
they will, after a careful study of the text, and exact attention
to the directions given, prove easy to carry out.,Many of these interesting designs are drawn from
private collections, whose owners, with great kindness,
placed their treasures at my disposal, to copy and borrow
from at discretion, for which I desire to take the present
opportunity, of tendering them my warmest thanks.,The choice of colours and material—a difficult matter
to many—my readers will find rendered comparatively
easy to them by the notes affixed to the illustrations; and
I may point out, that most of the patterns were worked
with D.M.C cottons, which enjoy the well-earned reputation
of being, the very best of their kind, in the market
of the world.,Experience has convinced me that, in many instances,
these cottons may with advantage take the place of wool,
linen thread, and even silk.,If this work meet with indulgent judges, and prove
really useful, I shall find ample reward in that fact for
the trouble and difficulties that have unavoidably attended
its completion.,,,☞ By the same Author ☜,ALBUM DE BRODERIES,AU POINT DE CROIX.,(Album of cross-stitch embroidery),BY TH. DE DILLMONT,32 Plates with 278 Designs, and a complete treatise
