,[iii],[iv],[v],In making this book I have tried to avoid poems
which have been translated before. A hundred and
forty of those I have chosen have not been translated
by any one else. The remaining thirty odd I have
included in many cases because the previous versions
were full of mistakes; in others, because the works in
which they appeared are no longer procurable. Moreover,
they are mostly in German, a language with
which my readers may not all be acquainted.,With some hesitation I have included literal versions
of six poems (three of the “Seventeen Old Poems,”
“Autumn Wind,” “Li Fu-jēn,” and “On the Death
of his Father”) already skilfully rhymed by Professor
Giles in “Chinese Poetry in English Verse.” They
were too typical to omit; and a comparison of the two
renderings may be of interest. Some of these translations
have appeared in the “Bulletin of the School of
Oriental Studies,” in the “New Statesman,” in the
“Little Review” (Chicago), and in “Poetry”
(Chicago).,[vi][vii],[x],[1],[2][3],Those who wish to assure themselves that they will
lose nothing by ignoring Chinese literature, often ask
the question: “Have the Chinese a Homer, an Aeschylus,
a Shakespeare or Tolstoy?” The answer must be that
China has no epic and no dramatic literature of importance.
The novel exists and has merits, but never became the instrument
of great writers.,Her philosophic literature knows no mean between the
traditionalism of Confucius and the nihilism of Chuang-tzŭ.
In mind, as in body, the Chinese were for the most part
torpid mainlanders. Their thoughts set out on no strange
quests and adventures, just as their ships discovered no
new continents. To most Europeans the momentary flash
of Athenian questioning will seem worth more than all the
centuries of Chinese assent.,[4],Yet we must recognize that for thousands of years the
Chinese maintained a level of rationality and tolerance that
the West might well envy. They had no Index, no Inquisition,
no Holy Wars. Superstition has indeed played its
part among them; but it has never, as in Europe, been
perpetually dominant. It follows from the limitations of
Chinese thought that the literature of the country should
excel in reflection rather than in speculation. That this is
particularly true of its poetry will be gauged from the
present volume. In the poems of Po Chü-i no close reasoning
or philosophic subtlety will be discovered; but a power
of candid reflection and self-analysis which has not been
rivalled in the West.,Turning from thought to emotion, the most conspicuous
feature of European poetry is its pre-occupation with love.
This is apparent not only in actual “love-poems,” but in
all poetry where the personality of the writer is in any way
obtruded. The poet tends to exhibit himself in a romantic
light; in fact, to recommend himself as a lover.,The Chinese poet has a tendency different but analogous.
He recommends himself not as a lover, but as a friend.
He poses as a person of infinite leisure (which is what we
should most like our friends to possess) and free from
worldly ambitions (which constitute the greatest bars to
friendship). He would have us think of him as a boon
companion, a great drinker of wine, who will not disgrace
a social gathering by quitting it sober.,To the European poet the relation between man and
woman is a thing of supreme importance and mystery. To
the Chinese, it is something commonplace, obvious—a need
of the body, not a satisfaction of the emotions. These he
reserves entirely for friendship.,[5],Accordingly we find that while our poets tend to lay stress
on physical courage and other qualities which normal women
admire, Po Chü-i is not ashamed to write such a poem as
“Alarm at entering the Gorges.” Our poets imagine themselves
very much as Art has portrayed them—bare-headed
and wild-eyed, with shirts unbuttoned at the neck as though
they feared that a seizure of emotion might at any minute
suffocate them. The Chinese poet introduces himself as a
timid recluse, “Reading the Book of Changes at the
Northern Window,” playing chess with a Taoist priest,
or practising caligraphy with an occasional visitor. If
“With a Portrait of the Author” had been the rule in the
Chinese book-market, it is in such occupations as these
that he would be shown; a neat and tranquil figure compared
with our lurid frontispieces.,It has been the habit of Europe to idealize love at the
expense of friendship and so to place too heavy a burden
on the relation of man and woman. The Chinese erred in
the opposite direction, regarding their wives and concubines
simply as instruments of procreation. For sympathy and
intellectual companionship they looked only to their friends.
But these friends were bound by no such tie as held women
to their masters; sooner or later they drifted away to
frontier campaigns, remote governorships, or country retirement.
It would not be an exaggeration to say that half
the poems in the Chinese language are poems of parting or
separation.,Readers of these translations may imagine that the culture
represented by Po Chü-i extended over the whole vast
confines of China. This would, I think, be an error. Culture
is essentially a metropolitan product. Chü-i was as
much dépaysé at a provincial town as Charles Lamb would[6]
have been at Botany Bay. But the system of Chinese
bureaucracy tended constantly to break up the literary
coteries which formed at the capitals, and to drive the
members out of the little corner of Shensi and Honan which
to them was “home.”,It was chiefly economic necessity which forced the poets
of China into the meshes of bureaucracy—backed by the
Confucian insistence on public service. To such as were
landowners there remained the alternative of agricultural
life, arduous and isolated.,The poet, then, usually passed through three stages of
existence. In the first we find him with his friends at the
capital, drinking, writing, and discussing: burdened by his
office probably about as much as Pepys was burdened by his
duties at the Admiralty. Next, having failed to curry favour
with the Court, he is exiled to some provincial post, perhaps
a thousand miles from anyone he cares to talk to. Finally,
having scraped together enough money to buy husbands for
his daughters, he retires to a small estate, collecting round
him the remnants of those with whom he had shared the
“feasts and frolics of old days.”,I have spoken hitherto only of poets. But the poetess
occupies a place of considerable importance in the first four
centuries of our era, though the classical period (T’ang
and Sung) produced no great woman writer. Her theme
varies little; she is almost always a “rejected wife,” cast
adrift by her lord or sent back to her home. Probably her
father would be unable to buy her another husband and
there was no place for unmarried women in the Chinese
social system. The moment, then, which produced such
poems was one of supreme tragedy in a woman’s life.,Love-poetry addressed by a man to a woman ceases after[7]
the Han dynasty; but a conventional type of love-poem, in
which the poet (of either sex) speaks in the person of a
deserted wife or concubine, continues to be popular. The
theme appears to be almost an obsession with the T’ang
and Sung poets. In a vague way, such poems were felt to
be allegorical. Just as in the Confucian interpretation of
the love-poems in the Odes (see below) the woman typifies
the Minister, and the lover the Prince, so in those classical
poems the poet in a veiled way laments the thwarting of
his own public ambitions. Such tortuous expression of
emotion did not lead to good poetry.,The “figures of speech,” devices such as metaphor,
simile, and play on words, are used by the Chinese with
much more restraint than by us. “Metaphorical epithets”
are occasionally to be met with; waves, for example, might
perhaps be called “angry.” But in general the adjective
does not bear the heavy burden which our poets have laid
upon it. The Chinese would call the sky “blue,” “gray,”
or “cloudy,” according to circumstances; but never “triumphant”
or “terror-scourged.”,The long Homeric simile, introduced for its own sake or
to vary the monotony of narrative, is unknown to Chinese
poetry. Shorter similes are sometimes found, as when the
half-Chinese poet Altun compares the sky over the Mongolian
steppe with the “walls of a tent”; but nothing could
be found analogous to Mr. T. S. Eliot’s comparison of the
sky to a “patient etherized on a table.” Except in popular
poetry, puns are rare; but there are several characters which,
owing to the wideness of their import, are used in a way
almost equivalent to play on words.,Classical allusion, always the vice of Chinese poetry,
finally destroyed it altogether. In the later periods (from[8]
the fourteenth century onwards) the use of elegant synonyms
also prevailed. I have before me a “gradus” of the
kind which the later poet used as an aid to composition.
The moon should be called the “Silver Dish,” “Frozen
Wheel,” or “Golden Ring.” Allusions may in this connection
be made to Yü Liang, who rode to heaven on the
crescent moon; to the hermit T’ang, who controlled the
genius of the New Moon, and kept him in his house as a
candle—or to any other of some thirty stories which are
given. The sun may be called “The Lantern-Dragon,” the
“Crow in Flight,” the “White Colt,” etc.,Such were the artificialities of later Chinese poetry.,Certain elements are found, but in varying degree, in all
human speech. It is difficult to conceive of a language in
which rhyme, stress-accent, and tone-accent would not to
some extent occur. In all languages some vowel-sounds
are shorter than others and, in certain cases, two consecutive
words begin with the same sound. Other such
characteristics could be enumerated, but for the purposes
of poetry it is these elements which man has principally
exploited.,English poetry has used chiefly rhyme, stress, and alliteration.
It is doubtful if tone has ever played a part; a conscious
use has sporadically been made of quantity. Poetry
naturally utilizes the most marked and definite characteristics
of the language in which it is written. Such characteristics
are used consciously by the poet; but less
important elements also play their part, often only in a
negative way. Thus the Japanese actually avoid rhyme;[9]
the Greeks did not exploit it, but seem to have tolerated it
when it occurred accidentally.,The expedients consciously used by the Chinese before
the sixth century were rhyme and length of line. A third
element, inherent in the language, was not exploited before
that date, but must always have been a factor in instinctive
considerations of euphony. This element was “tone.”,Chinese prosody distinguishes between two tones, a
“flat” and a “deflected.” In the first the syllable is enunciated
in a level manner: the voice neither rises nor sinks.
In the second, it (1) rises, (2) sinks, (3) is abruptly arrested.
These varieties make up the Four Tones of Classical
Chinese.[1],The “deflected” tones are distinctly more emphatic, and
so have a faint analogy to our stressed syllables. They are
also, in an even more remote way, analogous to the long
vowels of Latin prosody. A line ending with a “level” has
consequently to some extent the effect of a “feminine ending.”
Certain causes, which I need not specify here, led to
an increasing importance of “tone” in the Chinese language
from the fifth century onwards. It was natural that this
change should be reflected in Chinese prosody. A certain
Shēn Yo (A.D. 441-513) first propounded the laws of tone-succession
in poetry. From that time till the eighth century
the Lü-shih or “strictly regulated poem” gradually
evolved. But poets continued (and continue till to-day),
side by side with their lü-shih, to write in the old metre
which disregards tone, calling such poems Ku shih, “old
poems.” Previous European statements about Chinese[10]
prosody should be accepted with great caution. Writers
have attempted to define the lü-shih with far too great
precision.,The Chinese themselves are apt to forget that T’ang
poets seldom obeyed the laws designed in later school-books
as essential to classical poetry; or, if they notice that a
verse by Li Po does not conform, they stigmatize it as
“irregular and not to be imitated.”,The reader will infer that the distinction between “old
poems” and irregular lü-shih is often arbitrary. This is
certainly the case; I have found the same poem classified
differently in different native books. But it is possible to
enumerate certain characteristics which distinguish the two
kinds of verse. I will attempt to do so; but not till I have
discussed rhyme, the other main element in Chinese prosody.
It would be equally difficult to define accurately the difference
between the couplets of Pope and those of William
Morris. But it would not be impossible, by pointing out
certain qualities of each, to enable a reader to distinguish
between the two styles.,Rhyme.—Most Chinese syllables ended with a vowel or
nasal sound. The Chinese rhyme was in reality a vowel
assonance. Words in different consonants rhymed so long
as the vowel-sound was exactly the same. Thus ywet,
“moon,” rhymed with sek, “beauty.” During the classical
period these consonant endings were gradually weakening,
and to-day, except in the south, they are wholly lost. It is
possible that from very early times final consonants were
lightly pronounced.,The rhymes used in lü-shih were standardized in the
eighth century, and some of them were no longer rhymes
to the ear in the Mandarin dialect. To be counted as a[11]
rhyme, two words must have exactly the same vowel-sound.
Some of the distinctions then made are no longer audible
to-day; the sub-divisions therefore seem arbitrary. Absolute
homophony is also counted as rhyme, as in French. It is
as though we should make made rhyme with maid.,I will now attempt to distinguish between Ku-shih (old
style) and Lü-shih (new style).,Ku-shih (Old Style).,(a) According to the investigations of Chu Hua, an eighteenth
century critic, only thirty-four rhymes were used.
They were, indeed, assonances of the roughest kind.,(b) “Deflected” words are used for rhyming as freely as
“flat” words.,(c) Tone-arrangement. The tones were disregarded.
(Lines can be found in pre-T’ang poems in which five deflected
tones occur in succession, an arrangement which
would have been painful to the ear of a T’ang writer and
would probably have been avoided by classical poets even
when using the old style.),Lü-shih (New Style).,(a) The rhymes used are the “106” of modern dictionaries
(not those of the Odes, as Giles states). Rhymes in the flat
tone are preferred. In a quatrain the lines which do not
rhyme must end on the opposite tone to that of the rhyme.
This law is absolute in Lü-shih and a tendency in this direction
is found even in Ku-shih.,(b) There is a tendency to antithetical arrangement of
tones in the two lines of a couplet, especially in the last
part of the lines.,(c) A tendency for the tones to go in pairs, e.g. (A=flat,
B=deflected): AA BBA or ABB AA, rather than in threes.[12]
Three like tones only come together when divided by a
“cesura,” e.g., the line BB / AAA would be avoided, but not
the line BBAA / ABB.,(d) Verbal parallelism in the couplet, e.g.:,This device, used with some discretion in T’ang, becomes
an irritating trick in the hands of the Sung poets.,[1] Not to be confused with the Four Tones of the Mandarin dialect,
in which the old names are used to describe quite different enunciations.,The Odes.—From the songs current in his day Confucius
(551-479 B.C.) chose about three hundred which he regarded
as suitable texts for his ethical and social teaching. Many
of them are eulogies of good rulers or criticisms of bad ones.
Out of the three hundred and five still extant only about
thirty are likely to interest the modern reader. Of these
half deal with war and half with love. Many translations
exist, the best being those of Legge in English and of
Couvreur in French. There is still room for an English
translation displaying more sensitivity to word-rhythm than
that of Legge. It should not, I think, include more than
fifty poems. But the Odes are essentially lyric poetry, and
their beauty lies in effects which cannot be reproduced in
English. For that reason I have excluded them from this
book; nor shall I discuss them further here, for full information
will be found in the works of Legge or Couvreur.,Elegies of the Land of Ch’u.—We come next to Ch’ü
Yüan (third century B.C.) whose famous poem “Li Sao,”[13]
or “Falling into Trouble,” has also been translated by
Legge. It deals, under a love-allegory, with the relation
between the writer and his king. In this poem, sex and
politics are curiously interwoven, as we need not doubt they
were in Chü Yüan’s own mind. He affords a striking example
of the way in which abnormal mentality imposes
itself. We find his followers unsuccessfully attempting to
use the same imagery and rhapsodical verbiage, not realizing
that these were, as De Goncourt would say, the product
of their master’s propre névrosité.,“The Battle,” his one thoroughly intelligible poem, has
hitherto been only very imperfectly translated. A literal
version will be found on p. 23.,His nephew Sung Yü was no servile imitator. In addition
to “elegies” in the style of the Li Sao, he was the author of
many “Fu” or descriptive prose-poems, unrhymed but more
or less metrical.,The Han Dynasty.—Most of the Han poems in this book
were intended to be sung. Many of them are from the
official song-book of the dynasty and are known as Yo Fu
or Music Bureau poems, as distinct from shih, which were
recited. Ch’in Chia’s poem and his wife’s reply (p. 54) are
both shih; but all the rest might, I think, be counted as
songs.,The Han dynasty is rich in Fu (descriptions), but none
of them could be adequately translated. They are written
in an elaborate and florid style which recalls Apuleius or
Lyly.,The Chin Dynasty.,(1) Popular Songs (Songs of Wu). The popular songs
referred to the Wu (Soochow) district and attributed to the[14]
fourth century may many of them have been current at a
much earlier date. They are slight in content and deal with
only one topic. They may, in fact, be called “Love-epigrams.”
They find a close parallel in the coplas of
Spain, cf.:,A Han song, which I will translate quite literally, seems
to be the forerunner of the Wu songs.,(2) The Taoists.—Confucius inculcated the duty of public
service. Those to whom this duty was repulsive found support
in Taoism, a system which denied this obligation. The
third and fourth centuries A.D. witnessed a great reaction
against state service. It occurred to the intellectuals of
China that they would be happier growing vegetables in
their gardens than place-hunting at Nanking. They embraced
the theory that “by bringing himself into harmony
with Nature” man can escape every evil. Thus Tao
(Nature’s Way) corresponds to the Nirvana of Buddhism,
and the God of Christian mysticism.,They reduced to the simplest standard their houses,
apparel, and food; and discarded the load of book-learning
which Confucianism imposed on its adherents.,[15],The greatest of these recluses was T’ao Ch’ien (A.D.
365-427), twelve of whose poems will be found on p. 71,
seq. Something of his philosophy may be gathered from
the poem “Substance, Shadow, and Spirit” (p. 73), his
own views being voiced by the last speaker. He was not
an original thinker, but a great poet who reflects in an interesting
way the outlook of his time.,Liang and Minor Dynasties.—This period is known as
that of the “Northern and Southern Courts.” The north
of China was in the hands of the Tungusie Tartars, who
founded the Northern Wei dynasty—a name particularly
familiar, since it is the habit of European collectors to
attribute to this dynasty any sculpture which they believe
to be earlier than T’ang. Little poetry was produced in the
conquered provinces; the Tartar emperors, though they
patronized Buddhist art, were incapable of promoting literature.
But at Nanking a series of emperors ruled, most of
whom distinguished themselves either in painting or poetry.
The Chinese have always (and rightly) despised the literature
of this period, which is “all flowers and moonlight.” A few
individual writers, such as Pao Chao, stand out as exceptions.
 The Emperor Yüan-ti—who hacked his way to the
throne by murdering all other claimants, including his own
brother—is typical of the period both as a man and as a
poet. A specimen of his sentimental poetry will be found
on p. 90. When at last forced to abdicate, he heaped
together 200,000 books and pictures; and, setting fire
to them, exclaimed: “The culture of the Liang dynasty
perishes with me.”,T’ang.—I have already described the technical developments
of poetry during this dynasty. Form was at this[16]
time valued far above content. “Poetry,” says a critic,
“should draw its materials from the Han and Wei dynasties.”
With the exception of a few reformers, writers contented
themselves with clothing old themes in new forms. The
extent to which this is true can of course only be realized
by one thoroughly familiar with the earlier poetry.,In the main, T’ang confines itself to a narrow range of
stock subjects. The mise-en-scène is borrowed from earlier
times. If a battle-poem be written, it deals with the campaigns
of the Han dynasty, not with contemporary events.
The “deserted concubines” of conventional love-poetry
are those of the Han Court. Innumerable poems record
“Reflections on Visiting a Ruin,” or on “The Site of an
Old City,” etc. The details are ingeniously varied, but the
sentiments are in each case identical. Another feature is
the excessive use of historical allusions. This is usually
not apparent in rhymed translations, which evade such
references by the substitution of generalities. Poetry became
the medium not for the expression of a poet’s emotions,
but for the display of his classical attainments. The great
Li Po is no exception to this rule. Often where his translators
would make us suppose he is expressing a fancy of
his own, he is in reality skilfully utilizing some poem by
T’ao Ch’ien or Hsieh Ti’ao. It is for his versification that
he is admired, and with justice. He represents a reaction
against the formal prosody of his immediate predecessors.
It was in the irregular song-metres of his ku-shih that he
excelled. In such poems as the “Ssech’uan Road,” with
its wild profusion of long and short lines, its cataract of
exotic verbiage, he aimed at something nearer akin to
music than to poetry. Tu Fu, his contemporary, occasionally
abandoned the cult of “abstract form.” Both poets[17]
lived through the most tragic period of Chinese history. In
755 the Emperor’s Turkic favourite, An Lu-shan, revolted
against his master. A civil war followed, in which China
lost thirty million men. The dynasty was permanently enfeebled
and the Empire greatly curtailed by foreign incursions.
So ended the “Golden Age” of Ming Huang. Tu
Fu, stirred by the horror of massacres and conscriptions,
wrote a series of poems in the old style, which Po Chü-i
singles out for praise. One of them, “The Press-gang,” is
familiar in Giles’s translation. Li Po, meanwhile, was
writing complimentary poems on the Emperor’s “Tour in
the West”—a journey which was in reality a precipitate
flight from his enemies.,Sung.—In regard to content the Sung poets show even
less originality than their predecessors. Their whole energy
was devoted towards inventing formal restrictions. The
“tz’ŭ” developed, a species of song in lines of irregular
length, written in strophes, each of which must conform to
a strict pattern of tones and rhymes. The content of the
“tz’ŭ” is generally wholly conventional. Very few have
been translated; and it is obvious that they are unsuitable
for translation, since their whole merit lies in metrical dexterity.
Examples by the poetess Li I-an will be found in
the second edition of Judith Gautier’s “Livre de Jade.”
The poetry of Su Tung-p’o, the foremost writer of the
period, is in its matter almost wholly a patchwork of earlier
poems. It is for the musical qualities of his verse that he
is valued by his countrymen. He hardly wrote a poem
which does not contain a phrase (sometimes a whole line)
borrowed from Po Chü-i, for whom in his critical writings
he expresses boundless admiration.,[18],A word must be said of the Fu (descriptive prose-poems)
of this time. They resemble the vers libres of modern
France, using rhyme occasionally (like Georges Duhamel)
as a means of “sonner, rouler, quand il faut faire donner
les cuivres et la batterie.” Of this nature is the magnificent
“Autumn Dirge” (Giles, “Chinese Lit.,” p. 215) by
Ou-yang Hsiu, whose lyric poetry is of small interest.
The subsequent periods need not much concern us. In the
eighteenth century the garrulous Yüan Mei wrote his
“Anecdotes of Poetry-making”—a book which, while one
of the most charming in the language, probably contains
more bad poetry (chiefly that of his friends) than any in the
world. His own poems are modelled on Po Chü-i and Su
Tung-p’o.,This introduction is intended for the general reader. I
have therefore stated my views simply and categorically,
and without entering into controversies which are of interest
only to a few specialists.,As an account of the development of Chinese poetry these
notes are necessarily incomplete, but it is hoped that they
answer some of those questions which a reader would be
most likely to ask.,[19],It is commonly asserted that poetry, when literally translated,
ceases to be poetry. This is often true, and I
have for that reason not attempted to translate many poems
which in the original have pleased me quite as much as
those I have selected. But I present the ones I have chosen
in the belief that they still retain the essential characteristics
of poetry.,I have aimed at literal translation, not paraphrase. It
may be perfectly legitimate for a poet to borrow foreign
themes or material, but this should not be called translation.,Above all, considering imagery to be the soul of poetry,
I have avoided either adding images of my own or suppressing
those of the original.,Any literal translation of Chinese poetry is bound to be
to some extent rhythmical, for the rhythm of the original
obtrudes itself. Translating literally, without thinking
about the metre of the version, one finds that about two
lines out of three have a very definite swing similar to that
of the Chinese lines. The remaining lines are just too short
or too long, a circumstance very irritating to the reader,
whose ear expects the rhythm to continue. I have therefore
tried to produce regular rhythmic effects similar to those of
the original. Each character in the Chinese is represented
by a stress in the English; but between the stresses unstressed
syllables are of course interposed. In a few instances
where the English insisted on being shorter than[20]
the Chinese, I have preferred to vary the metre of my
version, rather than pad out the line with unnecessary
verbiage.,I have not used rhyme because it is impossible to produce
in English rhyme-effects at all similar to those of the original,
where the same rhyme sometimes runs through a whole
poem. Also, because the restrictions of rhyme necessarily
injure either the vigour of one’s language or the literalness
of one’s version. I do not, at any rate, know of any example
to the contrary. What is generally known as “blank
verse” is the worst medium for translating Chinese poetry,
because the essence of blank verse is that it varies the position
of its pauses, whereas in Chinese the stop always comes
at the end of the couplet.,[21],1. H. A. Giles, “Chinese Poetry in English Verse.” 1896. 212 pp.
Combines rhyme and literalness with wonderful dexterity.,2. Hervey St. Denys, “Poésies des Thang.” 1862. 301 pp. The
choice of poems would have been very different if the author had
selected from the whole range of T’ang poetry, instead of contenting
himself, except in the case of Li Po and Tu Fu, with making extracts
from two late anthologies. This book, the work of a great scholar, is
reliable—except in its information about Chinese prosody.,3. Judith Gautier, “Le Livre de Jade.” 1867 and 1908. It has been
difficult to compare these renderings with the original, for proper
names are throughout distorted or interchanged. For example, part
of a poem by Po Chü-i about Yang T’ai-chēn is here given as a complete
poem and ascribed to “Yan-Ta-Tchen” as author. The poet
Han Yü figures as Heu-Yu; T’ao Han as Sao Nan, etc. Such mistakes
are evidently due to faulty decipherment of someone else’s writing.
Nevertheless, the book is far more readable than that of St. Denys,
and shows a wider acquaintance with Chinese poetry on the part of
whoever chose the poems. Most of the credit for this selection must
certainly be given to Ting Tun-ling, the literatus whom Théophile
Gautier befriended. But the credit for the beauty of these often
erroneous renderings must go to Mademoiselle Gautier herself.,4. Anna von Bernhardi, in “Mitteil d. Seminar f. Orient. Sprachen,”

A gust of wind blew in and the king bared his breast to
meet it, saying: “How pleasant a thing is this wind which
I share with the common people.” Sung Yü answered:
“This is the Great King’s wind. The common people
cannot share it.” The king said: “Wind is a spirit of
Heaven and Earth. It comes wide spread and does not
choose between noble and base or between high and low.
How can you say ‘This is the king’s wind’?” Sung answered:
“I have heard it taught that in the crooked lemon-tree
birds make their nests and to empty spaces winds fly.
But the wind-spirit that comes to different things is not the
same.” The king said: “Where is the wind born?” and[25]
Sung answered: “The wind is born in the ground. It rises
in the extremities of the green p’ing-flower. It pours into
the river-valleys and rages at the mouth of the pass. It
follows the rolling flanks of Mount T’ai and dances beneath
the pine-trees and cypresses. In gusty bouts it whirls. It
rushes in fiery anger. It rumbles low with a noise like
thunder, tearing down rocks and trees, smiting forests and
grasses.,“But at last abating, it spreads abroad, seeks empty
places and crosses the threshold of rooms. And so growing
gentler and clearer, it changes and is dispersed and dies.,“It is this cool clear Man-Wind that, freeing itself, falls
and rises till it climbs the high walls of the Castle and enters
the gardens of the Inner Palace. It bends the flowers and
leaves with its breath. It wanders among the osmanthus
and pepper-trees. It lingers over the fretted face of the
pond, to steal the soul of the hibiscus. It touches the willow
leaves and scatters the fragrant herbs. Then it pauses in
the courtyard and turning to the North goes up to the Jade
Hall, shakes the hanging curtains and lightly passes into
the inner room.,“And so it becomes the Great King’s wind.,“Now such a wind is fresh and sweet to breathe and its
gentle murmuring cures the diseases of men, blows away
the stupor of wine, sharpens sight and hearing and refreshes
the body. This is what is called the Great King’s wind.”,The king said: “You have well described it. Now tell
me of the common people’s wind.” Sung said: “The common
people’s wind rises from narrow lanes and streets,
carrying clouds of dust. Rushing to empty spaces it attacks
the gateway, scatters the dust-heap, sends the cinders flying,
pokes among foul and rotting things, till at last it enters[26]
the tiled windows and reaches the rooms of the cottage.
Now this wind is heavy and turgid, oppressing man’s heart.
It brings fever to his body, ulcers to his lips and dimness
to his eyes. It shakes him with coughing; it kills him
before his time.,“Such is the Woman-wind of the common people.”,The following is a sample of Sung Yü’s prose:,By Sung Yü (third century B.C.),One day when the Chamberlain, master Tēng-t’u, was in
attendance at the Palace he warned the King against Sung
Yü, saying: “Yü is a man of handsome features and calm
bearing and his tongue is prompt with subtle sentences.
Moreover, his character is licentious. I would submit that
your Majesty is ill-advised in allowing him to follow you
into the Queen’s apartments.” The King repeated Tēng-t’u’s
words to Sung Yü. Yü replied: “My beauty of face
and calmness of bearing were given me by Heaven.
Subtlety of speech I learnt from my teachers. As for my
character, I deny that it is licentious.” The King said:
“Can you substantiate your statement that you are not
licentious? If you cannot, you must leave the Court.” Sung
Yü said: “Of all the women in the world, the most beautiful
are the women of the land of Ch’u. And in all the land of
Ch’u there are none like the women of my own village.
And in my village there are none that can be compared
with the girl next door.,[27],“The girl next door would be too tall if an inch were added
to her height, and too short if an inch were taken away.
Another grain of powder would make her too pale; another
touch of rouge would make her too red. Her eyebrows are
like the plumage of the kingfisher, her flesh is like snow.
Her waist is like a roll of new silk, her teeth are like little
shells. A single one of her smiles would perturb the whole city
of Yang and derange the suburb of Hsia-ts’ai.[3] For three
years this lady has been climbing the garden wall and
peeping at me, yet I have never succumbed.,“How different is the behaviour of master Tēng-t’u! His
wife has a wooly head and misshapen ears; projecting teeth
irregularly set; a crook in her back and a halt in her gait.
Moreover, she has running sores in front and behind.,“Yet Tēng-t’u fell in love with her and caused her to bear
him five children.,“I would have your Majesty consider which of us is the
debauchee.”,Sung Yü was not dismissed from court.,[3] Fashionable quarters in the capital of Ch’u state.,Anon. (first century B.C.),[4] Hades.,Anon. (first century B.C.),[5] A water-clock.,Anon. (first century B.C.),[32],[6] Capital of the kingdom of Chao, where the people were famous

Nineteen Pieces of Old Poetry. Some have been attributed to Mei
Shēng (first century B.C.), and one to Fu I (first century A.D.). They
are manifestly not all by the same hand nor of the same date. Internal
evidence shows that No. 3 at least was written after the date of Mei
Shēng’s death. These poems had an enormous influence on all subsequent
poetry, and many of the habitual clichés of Chinese verse are
taken from them. I have omitted two because of their marked inferiority.,[11] The opposite of a parting by death.,[12] The popular, but erroneous, interpretation of these two lines is:
,[40],[13] High officers.,[14] Who had no father, no husband, and no children.,[15] Name of a star. The Herd-boy, who is only figuratively speaking
a herd-boy, is like the friend who is no real friend.,[16] I.e. (supposing he went away in the autumn), remind him that

The waning of the moon symbolizes the waning of the lover’s affection.,By Wu-ti (157-87 B.C.), sixth emperor of the Han dynasty. He came
to the throne when he was only sixteen. In this poem he regrets that
he is obliged to go on an official journey, leaving his mistress behind
in the capital. He is seated in his state barge surrounded by his
ministers.,The above poem was written by Wu-ti when his mistress, Li Fu-jēn,
died. Unable to bear his grief, he sent for wizards from all parts of
China, hoping that they would be able to put him into communication
with her spirit. At last one of them managed to project her shape on
to a curtain. The emperor cried:,[50],Ssŭ-ma Hsiang-ju was a young poet who had lost his position at
court owing to ill-health. One day Cho Wēn-chün, a rich man’s
daughter, heard him singing at a feast given by her father. She
eloped with him that night, and they set up a wine-shop together.
After a time Hsiang-ju became famous as a poet, but his character
was marred by love of money. He sold love-poems, which the ladies
of the palace sent to the emperor in order to win his favour. Finally,
he gave presents to the “ladies of Mo-ling,” hoping to secure a concubine.
It was this step that induced his mistress, Cho Wēn-chün, to
write the following poem.,By General Su Wu (circa 100 B.C.),[52],(Parting from Su Wu),Li Ling and Su Wu were both prisoners in the land of the Huns.
After nineteen years Su Wu was released. Li Ling would not go back
with him. When invited to do so, he got up and danced, singing:,[53],About the year 110 B.C. a Chinese Princess named Hsi-chün was
sent, for political reasons, to be the wife of a central Asian nomad
king, K’un Mo, king of the Wu-sun. When she got there, she found
her husband old and decrepit. He only saw her once or twice a year,
when they drank a cup of wine together. They could not converse,
as they had no language in common.,Ch’in Chia (first century A.D.) was summoned to take up an appointment
at the capital at a time when his wife was ill and staying with
her parents. He was therefore unable to say goodbye to her, and sent
her three poems instead. This is the last of the three.,[18] Odes, v, 10.,By Sung Tzŭ-hou (second century A.D.),(She sees the fruit trees in blossom and, forgetting

write. The “Yo Fu Kuang T’i” says: Kao Huan attacked Pi, king
of Chou, but lost nearly half his men. Kao Huan fell ill of sadness and
Pi, to taunt him, sent out a proclamation, which said:,When this reached Kao Huan’s ears, he sat up in bed and tried to
comfort his officers. All the nobles were summoned to his room, and
Altun was asked to sing them a song about Tchirek, his native land.
He sang:,“Altun” means “gold” in Tartar. No one could teach him to write
the Chinese character for gold, till at last some one said: “Draw the
roof of your house and then put a few strokes underneath.” He thus
learnt, in a rough fashion, to write his own name.,[94][95],By Ch’ēn Tzŭ-ang (A.D. 656-698),By Wang Chi (circa A.D. 700),[96],By Wang Chi,[42] Written during the war which preceded the T’ang dynasty.,By Yüan Chieh (flourished circa A.D. 740-770).,Yüan Chieh, a contemporary of Li Po, has not hitherto been mentioned

He became a soldier, and in
1637 defeated the rebel, Hsü Tu. After the suicide of the last Ming
emperor, he offered his services to the Ming princes who were still
opposing the Manchus. In 1647 he headed a conspiracy to place the
Ming prince Lu on the throne. His plans were discovered and he was
arrested by Manchu troops. Escaping their vigilance for a moment,
he leapt into a river and was drowned.,The following song describes the flight of a husband and wife from
a town menaced by the advancing Manchus. They find the whole
country-side deserted.,[102][103],[104][105],Po Chü-i was born at T’ai-yüan in Shansi. Most of
his childhood was spent at Jung-yang in Honan. His
father was a second-class Assistant Department Magistrate.
He tells us that his family was poor and often in
difficulties.,He seems to have settled permanently at Ch’ang-an in
801. This town, lying near the north-west frontier, was
the political capital of the Empire. In its situation it somewhat
resembled Madrid. Lo-yang, the Eastern city, owing
to its milder climate and more accessible position, became,
like Seville in Spain, a kind of social capital.,Soon afterwards he met Yüan Chēn, then aged twenty-two,
who was destined to play so important a part in his
life. Five years later, during a temporary absence from
the city, he addressed to Yüan the following poem:,[106],Of Yüan’s appearance at this time we may guess something
from a picture which still survives in copy; it shows
him, a youthful and elegant figure, visiting his cousin
Ts’ui Ying-ying, who was a lady-in-waiting at Court.[45] At
this period of his life Po made friends with difficulty, not
being, as he tells us, “a master of such accomplishments
as caligraphy, painting, chess or gambling, which tend
to bring men together in pleasurable intercourse.” Two
older men, T’ang Ch’ü and Tēng Fang, liked his poetry
and showed him much kindness; another, the politician
K’ung T’an, won his admiration on public grounds. But
all three died soon after he got to know them. Later he
made three friends with whom he maintained a lifelong
intimacy: the poet Liu Yū-hsi (called Mēng-tē), and the
two officials Li Chien and Ts’ui Hsuan-liang. In 805 Yüan
Chēn was banished for provocative behaviour towards
a high official. The T’ang History relates the episode as
follows: “Yüan was staying the night at the Fu-shui Inn;
just as he was preparing to go to sleep in the Main Hall,
the court-official Li Shih-yüan also arrived. Yüan Chēn
should have offered to withdraw from the Hall. He did
not do so and a scuffle ensued. Yüan, locked out of the
building, took off his shoes and stole round to the back,
hoping to find another way in. Liu followed with a whip
and struck him across the face.”,The separation was a heavy blow to Po Chü-i. In a
poem called “Climbing Alone to the Lo-yu Gardens”
he says:,[107],In 804 on the death of his father, and again in 811 on
the death of his mother, he spent periods of retirement on
the Wei river near Ch’ang-an. It was during the second of
these periods that he wrote the long poem (260 lines) called
“Visiting the Wu-chēn Temple.” Soon after his return to
Ch’ang-an, which took place in the winter of 814, he fell
into official disfavour. In two long memorials entitled
“On Stopping the War,” he had criticized the handling of
a campaign against an unimportant tribe of Tartars, which
he considered had been unduly prolonged. In a series of
poems he had satirized the rapacity of minor officials and
called attention to the intolerable sufferings of the masses.,His enemies soon found an opportunity of silencing him.
In 814 the Prime Minister, Wu Yüan-hēng, was assassinated
in broad daylight by an agent of the revolutionary
leader Wu Yüan-chi. Po, in a memorial to the Throne,
pointed out the urgency of remedying the prevailing discontent.
He held at this time the post of assistant secretary
to the Princes’ tutor. He should not have criticized
the Prime Minister (for being murdered!) until the official
Censors had spoken, for he held a Palace appointment
which did not carry with it the right of censorship.,His opponents also raked up another charge. His
mother had met her death by falling into a well while
looking at flowers. Chü-i had written two poems entitled[108]
“In Praise of Flowers” and “The New Well.” It was
claimed that by choosing such subjects he had infringed
the laws of Filial Piety.,He was banished to Kiukiang (then called Hsün-yang)
with the rank of Sub-Prefect. After three years he was
given the Governorship of Chung-chou, a remote place in
Ssech’uan. On the way up the Yangtze he met Yüan Chēn
after three years of separation. They spent a few days together
at I-ch’ang, exploring the rock-caves of the neighbourhood.,Chung-chou is noted for its “many flowers and exotic
trees,” which were a constant delight to its new Governor.
In the winter of 819 he was recalled to the capital and
became a second-class Assistant Secretary. About this
time Yüan Chēn also returned to the city.,In 821 the Emperor Mou Tsung came to the throne.
His arbitrary mis-government soon caused a fresh rising
in the north-west. Chü-i remonstrated in a series of
memorials and was again removed from the capital—this
time to be Governor of the important town of Hangchow.
Yüan now held a judicial post at Ningpo and the two were
occasionally able to meet.,In 824 his Governorship expired and he lived (with the
nominal rank of Imperial Tutor) at the village of Li-tao-li,
near Lo-yang. It was here that he took into his household
two girls, Fan-su and Man-tzŭ, whose singing and dancing
enlivened his retreat. He also brought with him from
Hangchow a famous “Indian rock,” and two cranes of
the celebrated “Hua-t’ing” breed. Other amenities of his
life at this time were a recipe for making sweet wine,
the gift of Ch’ēn Hao-hsien; a harp-melody taught him
by Ts’ui Hsuan-liang; and a song called “Autumn[109]
Thoughts,” brought by the concubine of a visitor from
Ssech’uan.,In 825 he became Governor of Soochow. Here at the
age of fifty-three he enjoyed a kind of second youth, much
more sociable than that of thirty years before; we find him
endlessly picnicking and feasting. But after two years
illness obliged him to retire.,He next held various posts at the capital, but again fell
ill, and in 829 settled at Lo-yang as Governor of the
Province of Honan. Here his first son, A-ts’ui, was born,
but died in the following year.,In 831 Yüan Chēn also died.,Henceforth, though for thirteen years he continued to
hold nominal posts, he lived a life of retirement. In 832 he
repaired an unoccupied part of the Hsiang-shan monastery
at Lung-mēn,[46] a few miles south of Lo-yang, and lived
there, calling himself the Hermit of Hsiang-shan. Once
he invited to dinner eight other elderly and retired
officials; the occasion was recorded in a picture entitled
“The Nine Old Men at Hsiang-shan.” There is no evidence
that his association with them was otherwise than
transient, though legend (see “Mémoires Concernant les
Chinois” and Giles, Biographical Dictionary) has invested
the incident with an undue importance. He amused himself
at this time by writing a description of his daily life
which would be more interesting if it were not so closely
modelled on a famous memoir by T’ao Ch’ien. In the winter
of 839 he was attacked by paralysis and lost the use of
his left leg. After many months in bed he was again able
to visit his garden, carried by Ju-man, a favourite monk.,[110],In 842 Liu Yü-hsi, the last survivor of the four friends,
and a constant visitor at the monastery, “went to wander
with Yüan Chēn in Hades.” The monk Ju-man also died.,The remaining years of Po’s life were spent in collecting
and arranging his Complete Works. Copies were presented
to the principal monasteries (the “Public Libraries” of the
period) in the towns with which he had been connected.
He died in 846, leaving instructions that his funeral should
be without pomp and that he should be buried not in the
family tomb at Hsia-kuei, but by Ju-man’s side in the
Hsiang-shan Monastery. He desired that a posthumous
title should not be awarded.,The most striking characteristic of Po Chü-i’s poetry is
its verbal simplicity. There is a story that he was in the
habit of reading his poems to an old peasant woman and
altering any expression which she could not understand.
The poems of his contemporaries were mere elegant diversions
which enabled the scholar to display his erudition,
or the literary juggler his dexterity. Po expounded his
theory of poetry in a letter to Yüan Chēn. Like Confucius,
he regarded art solely as a method of conveying instruction.
He is not the only great artist who has advanced
this untenable theory. He accordingly valued his didactic
poems far above his other work; but it is obvious that
much of his best poetry conveys no moral whatever. He
admits, indeed, that among his “miscellaneous stanzas”
many were inspired by some momentary sensation or passing
event. “A single laugh or a single sigh were rapidly
translated into verse.”,The didactic poems or “satires” belong to the period
before his first banishment. “When the tyrants and favourites
heard my Songs of Ch’in, they looked at one another[111]
and changed countenance,” he boasts. Satire, in the
European sense, implies wit; but Po’s satires are as lacking
in true wit as they are unquestionably full of true
poetry. We must regard them simply as moral tales in
verse.,In the conventional lyric poetry of his predecessors he
finds little to admire. Among the earlier poems of the
T’ang dynasty he selects for praise the series by Ch’ēn
Tzŭ-ang, which includes “Business Men.” In Li Po and
Tu Fu he finds a deficiency of “fēng” and “ya.” The two
terms are borrowed from the Preface to the Odes. “Fēng”
means “criticism of one’s rulers”; “ya,” “moral guidance
to the masses.”,“The skill,” he says in the same letter, “which Tu Fu
shows in threading on to his lü-shih a ramification of
allusions ancient and modern could not be surpassed; in
this he is even superior to Li Po. But, if we take the
‘Press-gang’ and verses like that stanza:,what a small part of his whole work it represents!”,Content, in short, he valued far above form: and it was
part of his theory, though certainly not of his practice,
that this content ought to be definitely moral. He aimed
at raising poetry from the triviality into which it had sunk
and restoring it to its proper intellectual level. It is an
irony that he should be chiefly known to posterity, in
China, Japan, and the West, as the author of the “Everlasting
Wrong.”[47] He set little store by the poem himself,[112]
and, though a certain political moral might be read into it,
its appeal is clearly romantic.,His other poem of sentiment, the “Lute Girl,”[48] accords
even less with his stated principles. With these he ranks
his Lü-shih; and it should here be noted that all the satires
and long poems are in the old style of versification, while
his lighter poems are in the strict, modern form. With his
satires he classes his “reflective” poems, such as “Singing
in the Mountains,” “On being removed from Hsün-yang,”
“Pruning Trees,” etc. These are all in the old
style.,No poet in the world can ever have enjoyed greater contemporary
popularity than Po. His poems were “on the
mouths of kings, princes, concubines, ladies, plough-boys,
and grooms.” They were inscribed “on the walls of village-schools,
temples, and ships-cabins.” “A certain
Captain Kao Hsia-yü was courting a dancing-girl. ‘You
must not think I am an ordinary dancing-girl,’ she said to
him, ‘I can recite Master Po’s “Everlasting Wrong.”’
And she put up her price.”,But this popularity was confined to the long, romantic
poems and the Lü-shih. “The world,” writes Po to Yüan
Chēn, “values highest just those of my poems which I
most despise. Of contemporaries you alone have understood
my satires and reflective poems. A hundred, a
thousand years hence perhaps some one will come who
will understand them as you have done.”,The popularity of his lighter poems lasted till the Ming
dynasty, when a wave of pedantry swept over China. At
that period his poetry was considered vulgar, because it
was not erudite; and prosaic, because it was not rhetorical.,[113],Although they valued form far above content, not even the
Ming critics can accuse him of slovenly writing. His versification
is admitted by them to be “correct.”,Caring, indeed, more for matter than for manner, he
used with facility and precision the technical instruments
which were at his disposal. Many of the later anthologies
omit his name altogether, but he has always had isolated
admirers. Yüan Mei imitates him constantly, and Chao I
(died 1814) writes: “Those who accuse him of being
vulgar and prosaic know nothing of poetry.”,Even during his lifetime his reputation had reached
Japan, and great writers like Michizane were not ashamed
to borrow from him. He is still held in high repute there,
is the subject of a Nō Play and has even become a kind of
Shintō deity. It is significant that the only copy of his works
in the British Museum is a seventeenth-century Japanese
edition.,It is usual to close a biographical notice with an attempt
to describe the “character” of one’s subject. But I hold
myself absolved from such a task; for the sixty poems
which follow will enable the reader to perform it for himself.,[45] Yüan has told the story of this intrigue in an autobiographical
fragment, of which I hope to publish a translation. Upon this fragment
is founded the famous fourteenth-century drama, “The Western
Pavilion.”,[46] Famous for its rock-sculptures, carved in the sixth and seventh
centuries.,[47] Giles, “Chinese Literature,” p. 169.,[48] Giles, “Chinese Literature,” p. 165.,[114][115],[116],[49] Where the poet used to spend his holidays.,[50] Part of the great Nan Shan range, fifteen miles south of
